Using textual data spanning nine years, we construct an ideological space through text embeddings and apply trajectory analysis to map the ideological movement of these groups, exploring potential radicalisation or polarisation in users’ beliefs. Our findings suggest that most groups spreading climate change denial views occupy a shared ideological space, but are positioned on the periphery rather than at the centre. Additionally, we identify several distinct clusters of actors with similar movement patterns, some of which shift towards positions where climate change scepticism or increased problematisation of climate change issues is more prevalent. Finally, we discuss ways to interpret the dimensions of the resulting ideological space."

This chapter looks forward to some areas that inoculation theory might explore next in the context of science communication and crisis misinformation correction on social media. A conventional inoculation theory-based message has two key components: a forewarning and refutational preemption. The chapter offers a sample of some of the work done with inoculation theory and science communication in times of crises-from longstanding crises such as climate change to more contemporary crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic-including work that explores misinformation within the context of social media and the Internet. Inoculation theory has been established as a messaging strategy to protect against attacks on credibility, mostly in the context of politics. Inoculation theory was long thought to be a mostly cognitive process."

Eye-tracking is a technology that uses nearly infrared light to identify people's attention to stimuli with to a less than a millisecond of precision. Eye-tracking research examined understudied information-processing or attention mechanisms when individuals reviewed misinformation and correction messages on social media. People's attention paths were consistent with left-to-right and top-to-bottom viewing patterns when reading the social media messages. Understanding how people allocate their attention, the most valuable commodity on social media, is of critical importance in developing best practices in responding to and mitigating harmful climate change misinformation."

Methodology: We have a content analysis, qualitative and quantitative, based on observance of the “Decalogue of recommendations for reporting on climate change” –prepared by the Fundación Ecología y Desarrollo (ECODES) and the Research Group Dialectical Mediation of Social Communication– by the three mentioned newspapers. Results: The analysis has allowed us to verify that the information about COP28, published by the media analyzed, only partially observes the recommendations of the ECODES decalogue for reporting on climate change. Conclusions: The importance of the exercise of journalism is evident from the social responsibility that communication professionals have when approaching their work, especially when we talk about emergency situations, like in this case."

However, further studies that analyse the presence of the disinformation mitigation strategies in public health initiatives within specific contexts and which contains a multidimensional approach (gender, social and environmental) are required. Evidence shows that disinformation, information overload, misinformation or fake news on health issues are also influenced by these issues. Objective: The inclusion of the health disinformation dimension within national public implemented by the governments of Argentina and Spain before, during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, this paper incorporated a gender-based approach and social and environmental determinants in order to identify the limitations of these initiatives and offer certain recommendations. We conducted a descriptive, qualitative and quantitative study, as well as content analysis. We focused on documents from the websites of the national health ministries of Argentina and Spain, and digital repositories of regulations at the national level. Various strategies for systematic searches on government websites were designed and implemented. This included manual searches on Google. The first step involved a general analysis of all documents found by the searches, followed by a qualitative analysis of the documents that were related to health issues. Based on this work, a comprehensive and flexible framework of (pre-established and emerging) dimensions and categories of health disinformation and infodemics was generated. Results. The work was based on a total of 202 documents (both downloadable information and information included in websites); 117 for Argentina and 85 for Spain. Of the total, 60.9% were published during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the second stage of the analysis, 55 texts were selected for Argentina and 47 for Spain. In both countries, the central communications approach used was disinformation and/or infodemics (although definitions such as fake news were also used). They were mainly linked to the COVID-19 pandemic, but other emerging health problems were also detected to a lesser degree. However, disinformation (or a related concept) was prominently present in only 17 documents in Argentina and 3 documents in Spain. In terms of document type, working materials were foremost in Argentina (44.4%) and Spain (37.6%), with little presence of policy, regulatory and evaluation documents (only 5). Gender binary language was predominantly used in these texts. Vulnerable groups and social determinants were poorly included. Environmental determinants were mentioned in conjunction with health disinformation in only one paper on the use of plastics and its impact on human health in Argentina, and in another paper from the Global Summit on Climate and Health in Spain. Conclusions: Based on the document analysis, the inclusion of health disinformation within public actions in both countries before, during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, was detected. However, different limitations were observed: it was clear that the problem was strongly linked to the health emergency and did not extend much beyond that. Health disinformation was secondary and did not play a key role in public policy nor did it have greater institutional importance. Limitations were also detected in terms of gender perspectives, vulnerable groups and social and environmental determinants linked to health disinformation, displaying a reductionist approach. Based on these results, this paper makes certain policy recommendations."

This paper sets out to further our understanding of science skepticism and to inform both academic research and policymaking. Departing from a review of the academic literature on conceptualizations of science skepticism, we employ Eurobarometer 2021 data to explore the characteristics of people holding skeptical attitudes concerning climate change and evolution. Replicating prior findings, we observe minor variations across sociodemographic characteristics. Moreover, science skepticism relates to general science attitudes in a nonuniform manner within and across issues, and interest in and engagement with science are nonuniformly related to skepticism. Furthermore, science skepticism is inconsistent in its relationship to both attitudes and relationships with science across contexts. Based on the heterogeneous nature of skepticism(s), we argue that research and policy should be careful in approaching science skepticism as a general negative predisposition toward science."

With nearly half of the present internet traffic estimated to be generated by bots, and misinformation being regularly weaponised by numerous parties for economic or political gain, it is imperative that citizens are equipped with the tools to discriminate facts from fiction, particularly for health- and science-related matters. The present study reports the results of a survey (n = 776) carried out to evaluate susceptibility to scientific misinformation and perception of news source reliability amongst students in an English secondary school. Two distinct scores were developed in order to differentially measure susceptibility to disinformation (i.e. deliberately false information) and unintentional misinformation (i.e. getting the facts wrong). Non-parametric analysis indicated that students’ misinformation (as measured by both scores) decreased significantly over the course of the 5 years of secondary education. Interestingly, the adolescents who took part in the survey exhibited considerably lower belief in common science-based conspiracy theories than the levels previously reported among British adults. Students indicated teachers as their most frequent choice of scientific news. While social media were also indicated as common news sources, students expressed awareness of the unreliability of the content available on social media. Analysis of the open answers indicated that students considered BBC as the most trustworthy source of scientific information, and TikTok as the least trustworthy."
7,2-s2.0-85209357573,"© The Author(s) 2024.Misinformation about climate change is a complex societal issue that requires holistic, interdisciplinary solutions at the intersection between technology and psychology. One proposed solution is a “technocognitive” approach, involving the synthesis of psychological and computer science research. Psychological research has identified that interventions that counter misinformation require both fact-based (e.g., factual explanations) and technique-based (e.g., explanations of misleading techniques and logical fallacies) content. However, little progress has been made on documenting and detecting fallacies in climate misinformation. In this study, we apply a previously developed critical thinking methodology for deconstructing climate misinformation in order to develop a dataset mapping examples of climate misinformation to reasoning fallacies. This dataset is used to train a model to detect fallacies in climate misinformation. We evaluate the model’s performance using the F1 score, which measures how well the model detects relevant cases while avoiding irrelevant ones. Our study shows F1 scores that are 2.5–3.5 times better than previous works. The fallacies that are easiest to detect include fake experts and anecdotal arguments, while fallacies that require background knowledge, such as oversimplification, misrepresentation, and slothful induction, are relatively more difficult to detect. This research lays the groundwork for development of solutions where automatically detected climate misinformation can be countered with generative technique-based corrections."
8,2-s2.0-85208161306,"© The Author(s) 2024.Background: This paper summarizes data from 7 studies that used Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) to guide climate messaging with the goal of increasing climate-mitigating behavioral intentions. Together, the studies address 5 research questions. 1) Does PMT predict behavioral intentions in the context of climate change mitigation? 2) Does PMT work similarly for climate change deniers vs acknowledgers? 3) Are the effects of threat and efficacy additive or multiplicative? 4) Does adding measures of collective threat and efficacy improve the model accuracy for a collective problem like climate change? 5) Can threat and efficacy appraisals – and ultimately behavioral intentions – be shifted through climate messaging? Methods: Seven online experiments were conducted on US adults (N = 3,761) between 2020 and 2022. Participants were randomly assigned to a control condition or to one of several experimental conditions designed to influence threat, efficacy, or both. Participants indicated their belief in climate change, ethnicity, gender, and political orientation. They completed measures of personal threat and efficacy, collective threat and efficacy, and behavioral intentions. Results: Multiple regressions, ANCOVAs, and effect sizes were used to evaluate our research questions. Consistent with PMT, threat and efficacy appraisals predicted climate mitigation behavioral intentions, even among those who denied climate change. Different interactions emerged for climate deniers and acknowledgers, suggesting that in this context threat and efficacy are not just additive in their effects (but these effects were small). Including measures of collective threat and efficacy only modestly improved the model. Finally, evidence that threat and efficacy appraisals can be shifted was weak and inconsistent; mitigation behavioral intentions were not reliably influenced by the messages tested. Conclusions: PMT effectively predicts climate change mitigation behavioral intentions among US adults, whether they deny climate change or acknowledge it. Threat appraisals may be more impactful for deniers, while efficacy appraisals may be more impactful for acknowledgers. Including collective-level measures of threat and efficacy modestly improves model fit. Contrary to PMT research in other domains, threat and efficacy appraisals were not easily shifted under the conditions tested here, and increases did not reliably lead to increases in behavioral intentions."

Published by IOP Publishing Ltd.This study investigates the geographic correlation between flood risk, climate skepticism, and social vulnerability across the United States. Our results reveal a systematic underestimation of flood risk in the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) Flood Insurance Rate Maps, especially in Appalachia, parts of New England, and the Northwest. These three regions face two additional risks: high levels of social vulnerability and skepticism about climate change. Nationally, there is a statisically significant correlation (0.19, p < 0.005) between flood risk and climate change skepticism, which increases (0.28, p < 0.005) in regions with high FEMA undercounts and elevated flood risk. Climate change skepticism manifests as distrust in science, an underestimation of property and community risk, and a resistance to mitigation and adaptation efforts. Indicators of social vulnerability, such as poverty rates, physical disabilities, unemployment, households in mobile homes, and lack of vehicle access, are especially pronounced in Appalachia. Addressing this geographically-embedded triple exposure—flood risk, social vulnerability, climate change skepticism— requires strategies to enhance local resilience. These include revising the 100-year floodplain categorization in FEMA’s National Flood Insurance Program to better reflect climate change, conducting public education campaigns in vulnerable communities, and scaling-up financial assistance for flood mitigation and adaptation projects."

This study examines this phenomenon on Reddit, which employs a platform-wide content ranking system based on user upvotes and downvotes. By empowering users to influence content visibility, Reddit's system serves as a naturally occurring community moderation mechanism, providing an opportunity to analyse how users engage with this system. Focusing on discussions related to climate change, we observe that in this domain, low-credibility content is spontaneously moderated by Reddit users, although the magnitude of this effect varies across Subreddits. We also identify temporal fluctuations in content removal rates, indicating dynamic and context-dependent patterns influenced by platform policies and socio-political factors. These findings highlight the potential of community-based moderation in mitigating online false information, offering valuable insights for the development of robust social media moderation frameworks."

In this cross-national comparative study, we explore factors associated with both climate change denial and awareness. We analyze data from the European Social Survey (Wave 8) and additional country-level data to identify factors associated with each of these outcomes. We measure awareness as a composite index that aggregates multiple indicators, including beliefs about the existence of climate change, concern, causes, impact, and responsibility. Our findings indicate that climate change denial and awareness do not exist on a single scale. Climate change awareness is strongly influenced by individuals' socio-demographic characteristics, values, and political orientation. Higher levels of awareness are found among those who are more receptive to educational efforts that promote scientific knowledge. In contrast, climate change denial is weakly related to socio-demographic and political factors and is more influenced by individuals' worldviews and detachment from mainstream society. European post-socialist countries demonstrate distinct attitudes towards environmental issues, with lower average climate change awareness and a higher proportion of individuals denying climate change."

This study, therefore, aimed to investigate climate change disinformation across types, agents, and media platforms as reported in selected online newspapers. A total of 124 news articles gathered from Malaysia's The Star and New Straits Times were subjected to content analysis. The articles were collected from the newspapers’ digital archives between August 2015 and October 2021 using “climate change” and “disinformation” as keywords. Subsequently, data were analyzed using the Chi-square test and descriptive statistics. The study found that disinformation about climate change is more likely to be spread by politicians, organizations, and anonymous agencies compared with business tycoons, celebrities, and academics. Also, misleading and fabricated contents represent the most common types of disinformation spread by politicians. The findings suggest that politics and social media represent the most critical factors influencing climate change. The study, therefore, calls for the joint efforts of activists, media practitioners, and governments to mitigate disinformation about climate change."

With the consequences of climate change becoming a global issue, socio-psychological analysis becomes imperative to bring a change in attitude. The study maps the relationship between information sources, self-concern and the concern for climate change. The effect of denial as a mediating variable is investigated between information sources, self-concerns, and the perception of climate change. For this investigation, positivism was used. An exploratory descriptive study examined how information sources, self-concerns, denial, age, gender, qualification, and occupation affect climate change perspective. In July and August 2021, Google Forms were used to acquire a non-probability sample of 474 Indians. Convenience, judgement, and snowballing were employed to get the sample size. Smart PLS 3.3.2 (Smart PLS-SEM) employed partial least square–structural equation modelling. PLS-SEM confirmed the model's factors. According to the results denial completely mediates the association between self-concern and climate change perception, but not between information sources and perception of climate change. The research provides evidence that it is the care less attitude towards the environment and especially climate change that is hindering the change in behaviour of individuals. The research gives an interesting insight into the psychology of individuals. This emerging literature is particularly beneficial to understanding the reason behind failed attempts by environmentalists and scientists to bring a change in the behaviour of people. The research provides a crucial base for the direction of future efforts. As the denial of climate change is a defence strategy, the study suggests that awareness programmes should focus on this fact in order to devise approaches to bring about the desired shift in attitude and behaviour. Moreover, because self-concern increases climate change denial, narratives of policy efforts may emphasize the benefits to individuals."

Utilizing computational aesthetics across data, imagery, and sound, this work processes real-time data from X (Twitter) through a natural language processing learning model derived from cognitive sciences. It not only renders the statistical aspects of this data visually but also manifests its thermal effects. A unique audio dimension is introduced through dialogues between climate skeptics and climate advocates, processed by the generative machine learning (ML) algorithm Dicy2. These elements collectively shape the installation, each unveiling its distinctive algorithmic aesthetics and technical underpinnings. This paper concentrates on the dual application of ML algorithms: one for dissecting extensive online misinformation streams, and the other for creating climate-related dialogues. This dual approach opens a discussion on the mediation of climate, at the convergence of computational and physical realms. Our aim is to critically examine the role of ML technologies in crafting aesthetic experiences that resonate within scientific discourse and public debate on climate issues."

This was a groundbreaking proposal and would be the first comprehensive piece of binding international legislation that holds legally binding targets and deadlines for landscape-wide restoration. Although the Proposal initially received very positive reactions from a variety of stakeholders, including scientists, organizations, and companies, certain lobby groups—mainly from the primary sectors (agriculture, forestry, and fisheries)—led a strong campaign against the Proposal, often based on unfounded arguments and short-term considerations. After several nail-biting voting rounds, a political compromise on an amended text was finally reached and awaits final approval. The Compromise still provides an appropriate legal basis for upscaling restoration within the EU through clear targets on restoration for different ecosystems and implementation obligations for Member States. However, we argue that, since the Compromise weakens the Proposal on some vital points regarding the operationalization of restoration at the national level, it remains uncertain whether the final law will produce the tangible effects that are necessary in the coming years."

Despite substantial consensus among the scientific community on the reality of anthropogenic climate change, public opinion still remains divided. Combating the climate crisis requires immediate and meaningful actions; however, various actors generate and propagate climate change misinformation, with vested interests in sowing doubts in the public sphere about the reality and urgency of climate impacts. The United States of America, where public opinion holds a strong sway in many social and political spheres, acts as a pertinent case in point, where the prevalence of climate denial fueled by persistent climate change misinformation contributes to this divided public perspective. For this reason, it is imperative to enhance the understanding of the subtle ways climate change misinformation exists and functions. This article employs actor–network theory and the concept of black-boxing to explore a case of climate change misinformation in the United States, with the aim of comprehending the workings of climate change misinformation within its network."

22,2-s2.0-85193976098,"© 2024 The Author(s)Research has frequently found that less-educated citizens are more skeptical about climate change and show less trust in climate science than their more-educated counterparts. We advance insights on why this educational divide exists by: 1) scrutinizing the relevance of the dominant knowledge-deficit explanation by uniquely using an objective measure of scientific knowledge; and 2) theorizing and empirically testing a novel explanation on the importance of subjective social status. Building on recent sociological insights, we theorize that less-educated citizens have a lower subjective social status and feel misrecognized by more-educated citizens, inciting frustration and opposition toward the attitudes and lifestyle of the latter. Because belief in and concern about climate change are predominantly embraced by more-educated citizens and have strong status connotations, less-educated citizens’ opposition to the lifestyle of more-educated citizens is likely also directed at the issue of climate change. We test hypotheses derived from both approaches by analyzing unique survey data gathered among members of a high-quality panel representative of the Dutch population. We focus on two outcome measures: climate change skepticism and distrust in climate science. We find that both the knowledge-deficit approach and the novel explanation involving subjective social status contribute to understanding the educational divide in climate change attitudes, in addition to other approaches covered by control variables such as income and political ideology. Our study concludes with a reflection on the theoretical implications of these findings and their practical implications for information campaigns, which our study suggests should be careful not to prime less-educated citizens’ perceived lower social standing."

Hence, the high degree of complexity which emerges from the involvement of such a large number of people might be better understood through the lenses of their individual differences. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis following PRISMA guidelines. We searched keywords on Web of Science™ and Scopus®, and included peer-reviewed articles which quantitatively examined correlations between personality and climate attitudes. After screening, 74 papers were included in our review. From these articles, k = 100 samples were extracted and included in meta-analysis models. Our results show that Climate Change Denial is positively correlated with Social Dominance Orientation (r = 0.39) and Right-Wing Authoritarianism (r = 0.42), and negatively with Openness (r = −0.14), Conscientiousness (r = −0.05), Agreeableness (r = −0.11), Consideration of Future Consequences (r = −0.38), and Actively Open-Minded Thinking (r = −0.38). Concern for Climate Change correlates with Openness (r = 0.10), Neuroticism (r = 0.12), Consideration of Future Consequences (r = 0.34), and negatively with Social Dominance Orientation (r = -0.36) and Right-Wing Authoritarianism (r = −0.22). Finally, Proactivity towards Climate Change correlates positively with Openness (r = 0.17), Extraversion (r = 0.09), Agreeableness (r = 0.05), Neuroticism (r = 0.10), Consideration of Future Consequences (r = 0.39), and negatively with Social Dominance Orientation (r = -0.25) and Right-Wing Authoritarianism (r = -0.31). Moderation analysis shows geographical variations in the Social Dominance Orientation and Climate Denial relationship. We conclude that some personality traits – such as Openness – transversally affect climate change attitudes. Moreover, meta-analytic data suggest that the personality involvement in Climate Change may be dependent on the socio-political context of different countries. Future research, policies, and communication campaigns should take these peculiarities into account."

Through a systematic selection and analysis of 65 scientific articles, this review finds multiple intervention forms, including education, message framing and inoculation. The intentions of intervening range from changing understanding of climate science, science advocacy, influencing mitigation attitudes and counteracting vested industry. A number of divergent findings emerge: whether to separate science from policy; the disputed effects of emotions and the longitudinal impacts of interventions. The review offers guiding questions for those interested in counteracting denialism, the answers to which indicate particular strategies: identify the form of climate denial; consider the purpose of intervention and recognise one’s relationship to their audiences."

The analysis suggests there is an evolving public talk on climate where overt denial of climate science is increasingly seen at the political extreme and the more mainstream discourse, described here as an ecomodern discourse, appears aligned with climate science but delays the necessary immediate action to address climate change by among other things using fearful scenarios to argue against disrupting the status quo and appealing to technology to solve climate change."

How unbiased online users experience and cope with dissonance triggered by this, and whether this affects their pre-existing attitudes, has hardly been explored. This research gap is addressed using the polarized topic of climate change as an example. An experimental research design is applied combining stimulus exposure, survey research, eye tracking, and interviews (n = 50). The findings indicate that unbiased users are not entirely resistant to disinformation influence. However, attitude effects could not be fully explained by selection behavior but instead through different feelings and strategies of coping with dissonance and patterns of performing online information searches."

I argue that a major type of religiosity has been missed: that which is expressed in conservative media. This religiosity is not associated with religious institutions but rather takes the form of civil religion. Because the US is now religiously polarized, today’s civil religion differs from what Bellah identified in 1967: rather than serving to unify the entire country, it serves to unify the political right, setting it against what is constructed as the secular left. I show how the religious discourse Rush Limbaugh employed on his radio broadcasts exemplifies this new civil religion, and further, that he used civil religious arguments to denigrate climate action. The new civil religiosity on the right, sometimes called Christian nationalism, reduces support for climate legislation by portraying a powerful federal government as a threat to religious liberty."

These features result in a lag in collective climate action and sometimes foster climate skepticism and climate denial. While the literature on climate change perception and belief has thoroughly explored its sociocultural and sociopolitical aspects, research on the potential contribution of psychophysiological factors remains scarce. In this perspective paper, we outline evidence and arguments for the involvement of psychophysiological systems such as thermoception, hygroreception, and interoception in modulating climate change awareness. We discuss psychophysiological mechanisms of climate change awareness in animals and humans, as well as possible sources of individual variance in climate change perception.

Those aspects were explored from the point of view of American and Polish climate scientists through the method of in-depth interviewing. According to the scientists, as the study results show, the most effective way to enhance science-society dialogue on climate change is to detangle from unproductive denial narratives and truly embrace the dialogic model of science communication by opening it to feedback, including honest societal scepticism."
30,2-s2.0-85183978822,"© 2024 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing LtdExtreme weather events linked to climate change are becoming more frequent. The online public discourse on and during these events, especially on social media, attracts misinformation that can undermine short-term emergency responses, but can also be aimed at influencing long-term public perceptions of climate change. This contribution reviews existing research on online misinformation with the aim to understand the types, origins, and potential impacts of misinformation during extreme weather events like storms, floods, and wildfires. The screening of 289 publications reveals that there is scarce body of only 13 studies addressing this question. Relevant studies exploring online misinformation during extreme weather events rarely document misinformation immediately relevant for emergency responses and only recently link this to the discussion about climate change. The reviewed research provides however insights to derive a framework that can guide future research into this topic. Specifically, that misinformation in social media during environmental emergencies 1) cuts across domains and merges different areas of public interest, 2) cuts across temporal and geographical scales, and 3) needs to be studied as part of an interconnected online media landscape. Misinformation differs between emergency event types, can undermine the debate about climate change in diverse ways, appeal to completely different audiences and thus will likely require different responses and countermeasures. Structured research with comparable methodologies is urgently needed."

In this article, we bring together critical, feminist perspectives on masculinity and environmental dominance and social psychological insights from system justification theory to hypothesize that identity-protective cognition, material interests, and ideological legitimation processes combine and reinforce one another to motivate obstructionism when it comes to taking climate action. Our hope is that by integrating critical and empirical approaches to social science—and illuminating individual and group psychological factors that are embedded in specific historical and political settings—it will be possible to increase solidarity among environmental scholars and activists and forge a shared vision of climate justice across disciplines."

The problem of global warming has been addressed not only by political leaders and environmental advocates but by religious leaders and faith communities as well. Here we continue a long tradition of social science research into the impact of religious factors on public environmental attitudes. Despite the much-discussed ""greening of religion, "" we find considerable differences among members of American religious groups on environmental policy, differences that have remained quite consistent over the past three decades. Although ethnoreligious affiliation, religiosity, and religious beliefs all have substantial relationships with environmental views, we find that theological traditionalism is the strongest religious influence on environmentalism in multivariate analysis, largely absorbing the effects of affiliation and religiosity. We also discover that political and ideological variables mediate part, but not all, of the influences of religion."

However, the growing threat of disinformation on these platforms challenges climate change mitigation efforts. The political motives underlying the orchestration of such disinformation campaigns disseminate falsehoods about scientific consensus, sow ambiguity, and undermine scientific progress. Despite its adverse effects, comparative perspectives on social media disinformation from various entities have received minimal attention in the existing literature. Acknowledging the complex dynamics of disinformation operations and the diverse range of threat scenarios they create, this study utilizes the theoretical framework of agenda-building and qualitative comparative analysis to conduct a comprehensive cross-country assessment across 167 countries. Two sets of analyses with various time lags reveal the decisive influence of social media disinformation operations by governments and political parties on climate change mitigation initiatives and shed light on the diminishing significance of foreign disinformation. Over-all, the findings indicate how multiple disinformation campaigns interact to undermine the effectiveness of climate actions. Implications to research and practice are discussed."

Despite emerging research on the topic, their beliefs and willingness to support climate action remain poorly understood. Here, we conduct a mixed-methods study with a demographically quasirepresentative sample of U.S. adults (N = 939) to examine distinct narratives amongst those who believe in the natural causation of climate change. Inductive coding of participants’ open-ended essay responses about climate change identified three subcategories reflecting the degree of human influence (in addition to natural influence) that those espousing these arguments acknowledged: no influence, minimal influence, and meaningful influence. We then examined each subcategory’s support for climate policy and intentions to engage in pro-climate action in comparison to those who expressed outright disbelief in climate change and those who did not express contrarian arguments. Interestingly, while those who argued for natural causation of climate with minimal or no human influence reported statistically similar policy support and behavioral intentions to those who outright denied the existence of climate change, those who argued for natural causation with meaningful human influence reported statistically similar policy support and behavioral intentions to those who did not espouse contrarian arguments. Taken together, these results shed light on the diversity of views amongst those who argue for natural causes of climate change."
35,2-s2.0-85214010138,"Copyright © 2024 (Pellegrini, Loner).Scientists, policy-makers, entrepreneurs, and citizens are strongly concerned about the harmful consequences of climate change. Individual beliefs about social norms and economic and political orientations regarding trust and social relationships call into question values such as care for the environment, autonomy, freedom of choice, and risk. Given the influence of the media on public perceptions, it is essential to consider how, with what means, and towards which issues citizens orient themselves to address this epochal phenomenon. Using quantitative and qualitative methods of analysis, the present study investigates the characteristics and reasons of the individuals who are skeptical of the evidence of global warming in Italy and how the Italians inform themselves about this issue. Quantitative analysis was performed on two representative samples of 1011 and 1030 individuals from Observa Science in Society in 2022 and 2023 through a structural equation model (SEM) to study the dimensions associated with climate change skepticism. Qualitative research on a panel of 93 Italians selected by gender, cultural level, and area of residence further highlighted the information channels, methods of use, and the main dimensions of interest in climate change. This robust mixed-mode methodology, which ensures the credibility and reliability of the study's findings, is a key strength of this research. Our results confirm that less trust in science and older age are associated with skepticism. Furthermore, traditional media are the primary means of information despite the growing importance of social relations - including social networks - in shaping opinions on the environment and climate change. The conclusions also reveal that experts influence the public, even if personal experience often mediates this effect. These findings have practical implications for understanding and addressing climate change skepticism in Italy, equipping researchers, policymakers, and individuals interested in this issue with the knowledge to make informed decisions and take effective action."

It focuses on online search behaviors related to “climate”, “climate change”, “climate hoax”, and “HAARP” throughout 2023. By tracking search patterns, we aim to understand public perceptions, concerns, and the influence of misinformation on climate change discourse. Our findings indicate a strong temporal and regional variability in search interest, which spikes notably during significant events like Earth Day and in response to public statements by influential figures. The results demonstrate high engagement in regions with direct climate impact, such as Africa and parts of Asia, contrasted with varied engagement in Western nations. Notably, the data reveals significant public intrigue following conspiracy narratives during specific periods, which emphasizes the role of misinformation in shaping public discourse. This analysis underscores the need for targeted communication strategies to effectively address public misconceptions and enhance the understanding of climate-related issues. This research highlights the utility of Google Trends as a tool for real-time monitoring of public interest and misinformation and offers valuable insights for policymakers, educators, and activists to tailor their approaches to combat climate change more effectively. Through its comprehensive analysis, the study contributes to the broader understanding of how digital tools can aid in the ongoing efforts to engage the public in meaningful climate action discussions."

This research investigates the actors involved and their visibility in search engines to better understand how Google algorithms structure the communication in Spanish surrounding this issue. The searches and results about climate change in six Spanish-speaking countries have been observed using a mixed methodology based on digital methods and discourse qualitative analysis. Many searches directly engage with the debate about the veracity of climate change. Traditional media or well-established sources in each country’s market tend to have better positioning in Google.

However, pro-environmental disinformation is also possible, exaggerating climate change consequences or green policies benefits. Anti- and pro-environmental disinformation can negatively influence citizens’ political decision-making. The aim of this research is to analyze the disinformation coming from Spanish political actors, to check what issues they focus on and if there is an ideological bias in the dissemination of false information related to climate change and the environment. The investigation is based on verifications carried out by fact-checkers Newtral and Maldita on statements made by Spanish politicians. From a quantitative perspective, all fact-checks performed from October 2018 to March 2023 are analyzed (N = 1,415). The study covers a time frame of almost five years, which includes elections at European and national level. We classified each disinformation according to date, source, and topic, and we make a taxonomic proposal of environmental disinformation, be it anti- or pro-environmental action. We aim to find out what kind of environmental disinformation is used in Spain to cover the lack of studies in this field. Also to check the differences in the disinformation strategy of the parties, especially in the radical right. Results reveal for the first time the presence of pro-environmental disinformation. However, disinformation is mostly anti-environmental and occupies a low level within the disinformation strategy of the parties, which reflects the low interest in this issue. Findings show that denialism is on the decline. Instead, anti-environmentalism has become more pragmatic and prevails through inactivism. Conservative parties lead in environmental disinformation, although it is more frequent in the more moderate ones. There is also an increase in this type of disinformation before the European election, which suggests an instrumental use at the political level where the environment is perceived to be more relevant."

Due to the various interests it involves, the issue is the target of constant misinformation on digital social networks. The messages, referring to the years 2017 to 2023, were collected, filtered and categorized based on Mann's proposal (2021) to answer the question of how climate denialist knowledge is constructed in Telegram groups in Brazil, by using content analysis. The supporting theories refer to the arguments that the constructions of these narratives are related to a cultural perspective: people interpret scientific evidence based on beliefs, values and ideologies; that climate denialism is directed by groups that support economic and conservative interests.

We hypothesize that threatened masculinity contributes to such gender differences in Sweden. Threatened masculinity refers to the perception that a man’s masculinity is being challenged, undermined, or devalued, often due to societal changes that advance women’s rights. Given that environmental care and concern are typically associated with femininity, men who perceive that masculinity is threatened may be more likely to deny climate change to restore a sense of masculinity. Across three cross-sectional online surveys with representative samples of Swedish adults (total N = 2,476), men were more likely to deny climate change than women. Threatened masculinity—measured by belief in a shift in sexism and belongingness with men’s rights activists—predicted climate change denial. In line with our hypothesis, belief in a sexism shift and, to a lesser extent, belongingness with men’s rights activists mediated from gender to climate change denial. Hence threatened masculinity contributes to a higher tendency among men compared to women to deny climate change in these samples. This research adds to the understanding of gender gaps in environmental attitudes found in many Western countries and highlights climate change denial as a potential correlate of the growing gender-related polarization observed in these contexts."

In a 2 (social endorsement: low vs. high) × 3 (motive: accuracy vs. impression vs. control) between-subjects experiment with 374 participants skeptical of anthropogenic climate change, high social endorsement cues (likes, comments, and shares) reduced pro-climate policy support in no-motive control condition. However, when participants were primed to seek accurate information, social endorsement positively influenced pro-climate policy support. This effect was explained by normative perceptions, supportive arguments, and message persuasiveness. Participants primed to focus on social impressions indicated greater policy support responding to high social endorsement than the no-motive control. Yet, within the impression-motive condition, high and low social endorsement did not make a significant difference. The study advances understanding of social endorsement effects, offering practical suggestions for combatting climate change misbeliefs."
42,2-s2.0-85212303817,"© The Author(s) 2024.Denial and far-right populism are regularly blamed for the inability of liberal democracies in the Global North to address climate change properly. But what is the nexus of populism and climate obstruction? In this article, I explore how ideational and discursive approaches to populism illuminate mechanisms of climate obstruction. While ideational approaches erroneously imply that there is a line of climate political conflict between “bad” populism and “good” anti-populism, discursive approaches suggest a contingent and relational character of populism, anti-populism, and climate obstruction. They not only enable raising awareness of the strategic–authoritarian character of far-right obstruction and the prevalence of obstruction beyond the far right but also prompt that anti-populist responses qua anti-populism contribute to obstruction by depoliticising climate politics. Eco-populist responses to obstruction that feature a political–strategic proximity to discursive approaches to populism, however, overlook an unresolved tension between agendas of inclusion via economic growth and agendas of ecological limitation. By ignoring this tension, they fail to capture societal boundaries of transformation, and they spread unwarranted strategies to break through climate obstruction politically. Therefore, I argue that instead of establishing a conflict line or a contingent relation, far-right obstruction, anti-populist, and eco-populist responses result in a tacit alliance in climate obstruction. To overcome this deadlock, I suggest research on (far-right) climate obstruction to focus on multiple entanglements of authoritarian defences of an unsustainable and imperial mode of living."

For this purpose, the current study examines the mediating role of decent work (DW) and the moderating role of climate change skepticism (CSS) in the relationship between GHPWS and GSI. Design/methodology/approach: Overall data collected from 262 Pakistan banking employees analyzed through the SPSS PROCESS macro supports this model. Findings: Findings suggest that GHWPS increased GSI through DW. The positive effect of DW on GSI was particularly high for the employees with low CCS. Research limitations/implications: Theoretically, this study expands knowledge in sustainable business practices and human resource management. Practically, it offers organizations strategies to integrate sustainability into their operations. This study implies that human resource management must be realigned with the overall organizational sustainability strategy to adopt environmental innovations. Along with the commercial and economic outcomes, this research has implications for public policy by advocating for practices that support environmental sustainability and DW. Societally, it promotes awareness of the importance of sustainability in business, which has a potential ripple effect on public attitudes and improves quality of life through environmental preservation. Originality/value: This study provides unique insights into the employees’ doubts about anthropogenic climate change and the importance of organizations implementing GHPWS toward cultivating DW and GSI in the context of developing countries."

This article takes a theoretical-analytical approach to understand how these narratives may be negatively impacting climate change action by aligning with ""climate obstructionism"". A double connection is identified: on the one hand, in discursive strategies and, on the other hand, in the social media behaviour of those who engage in ""anti-chemtrail activism"". At the discursive level, two parallels are found with the strategies of secondary obstruction of climate policy: the redirection of responsibility and the discourse of surrender. At the online behavioural level, attacks on the scientific com- munity and public institutions are found to contribute to the obstruction of climate action. In general, it is established that theories about chemtrails encourage ""tertiary obstruction"" linked to social structures that underpin the paralysis of climate action."

Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.Although climate change remains a top environmental threat, significant portions of the global population continue to exhibit climate change skepticism. Currently, an extensive literature identifies the micro-level determinants of climate skepticism, often manifesting as a form of populist “backlash” to the adverse effects of globalization. However, the potential of macro-level global cultural forces—particularly embeddedness in liberal world society—to counter such pushback is unclear. Using multilevel modeling to analyze International Social Survey Program data spanning 37 countries from 2000 to 2020, we find that in general, increased embeddedness is linked to reduced climate skepticism. However, when global liberal forces encounter anti-liberal undercurrents within nation-states, a situation we refer to as cultural dissonance, the impact of liberal world society on tempering skepticism varies. Embeddedness mitigates skepticism at the national level, particularly within authoritarian regimes, but not at the individual level, especially among right-wing individuals. Paradoxically, world society also heightens ideological polarization of individual worldviews on climate change. By illuminating the contradictory role of liberal world society, which simultaneously exacerbates and inhibits anti-liberal, populist attitudes about climate change, we advance existing work examining the post-liberal turn and holds promise for making sense of other issue domains where liberal perspectives are contested."

According to previous reviews, the dissemination of this misinformation on various social media platforms requires deeper exploration. Moreover, the findings reported applied mainly to the context of the United States, limiting the possibility of extending the results to other settings. Objective: This study aims to assess the current state of knowledge about misinformation concerning climate change and related environmental events that are circulating on social media. More specifically, we will explore past and current themes, actors, and sources, and the dissemination of this misinformation within the Canadian context. Methods: This scoping review protocol follows the methodological approach developed by Arksey and O’Malley and advanced by Levac, complemented by the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) checklist and the best practice guidance for the development of scoping review protocols. Following the identification of the research questions and assisted by a specialized librarian, we developed search strategies for selected bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and GreenFILE) and for gray literature (Google and pertinent databases) searches. Bibliographic and gray literature will be searched to identify relevant publications. In total, 2 members of our team will use the review software Covidence (Veritas Health Innovation) to independently select publications to include in the review. Publications specifically addressing our research questions, peer-reviewed, evidence-based, and published from January 1, 2000, in the full-text version in English or French will be included. Data will be extracted from the included publications to chart, among other items, the years of publication, geographic areas, themes, actors, and sources of the climate change–related misinformation and conclusions reported. Our team will then synthesize the extracted data to articulate the current state of knowledge relating to our research inquiries. Results: The research questions were identified in January 2024. The search strategies were developed from January to March 2024 for MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science and in July 2024 for GreenFILE and gray literature. MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science searches were launched on March 26, 2024. The first of 2 rounds of selection of publications identified through these databases was achieved in April 2024. Conclusions: This protocol will enable us to identify the evolution of themes, actors, and sources of misinformation regarding climate change and related environmental events on social media, including the latest platforms, and to potentially identify a context particular to Canada. As misinformation is known to undermine actions and public support in the fight against climate change, we intend to facilitate the targeting of efforts to combat misinformation related to climate change in an up-to-date and contextualized manner."

Our objective is to determine whether immersive VR can achieve more effective correction outcomes compared to social media. We employ a mixed experimental design, manipulating the provision of correction through either VR or social media. We measure the impact of these interventions on belief in and skepticism toward climate change, and on inferential reasoning at three different points over a month. Furthermore, we explore the effectiveness of human actors and the level of presence in the VR experience as strategies to combat climate change misinformation. We find that VR conditions might lead to increased certainty in the belief that climate change is really happening and lowered skepticism toward the clarity of the effects of climate change. Moreover, we find significant differences in the heart rate (HR) of the participants in the VR conditions. The use of avatars in VR environments may contribute to heightened HR variability during misinformation correction, potentially due to increased emotional engagement and cognitive load."

The way humanity responds to this threat – which is less than ideal, given that the movie ends with humanity’s destruction – is supposed to be an allegory for how humanity is dealing with the real-world threat of climate change. Consequently, we argue, the movie is an argument that presents the viewer with a moral imperative: Do all that you can to prevent climate change. But does the argument work? To answer this question, we look at criticism of the movie, decipher its messages, examine the aptness of its analogy, and use the philosophy of Plato, Kant, and Peter Singer to explain exactly what kind of argument the film is. In the end, we conclude that, while most (although not all) criticisms of the film fall flat – it doesn’t really matter. Given that the moral imperative presented by the movie is undeniable, the only appropriate response to the film is an unrelenting effort to fulfill our duty to stop climate change."

A mixed-methods analysis was conducted on tweets from twelve organizations known for opposing climate policies. Out of an initial 96,607 tweets, 803 relevant messages were selected to evaluate thematic content and interaction reach. The analysis identified five dominant thematic areas in the tweets: economic impacts of climate policy, ideological perspectives, questioning of official science, proposed technological solutions, and other messages. The higher levels of interaction were generated by messages with a political or ideological focus and those proposing technological solutions. In addition, most hyperlinks directed users to the think tanks' own websites rather than to external sources.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper used an experimental design. About 266 respondents recruited via the Prolific platform were invited to participate in an online study. A between-subject design was used, and data was analysed using the bootstrapping technique, allowing to identify moderators of the relationship between CSR communication framing and different evaluations of a company. Findings: The paper provides empirical support for the role of political preferences and climate change beliefs in predicting the preference for positive attribute framing among climate change sceptical audiences. It is argued that climate change sceptics are still in the process of deliberation about whether climate change is occurring. Research limitations/implications: The research findings may not be generalizable to countries where support for climate change is low, and a technique like attribute framing may not lead to noticeable differences in message reception. Practical implications: The paper underscores the impact of the type of attribute framing in CSR communication on different aspects of company evaluations depending on beliefs in climate change. Commercial communicators should additionally invest in climate change education to address the climate change challenge. Social implications: Addressing climate change effectively requires support from companies to communicate their CSR efforts purposefully and to address climate change sceptical audiences.

By establishing shared values, planning research meticulously, conducting research collaboratively, and reporting findings transparently, ESIs can foster a culture of prevention and accountability in research. Ultimately, navigating beyond traditional methodologies to support RCR necessitates a fundamental reimagining of academic culture, reconceptualizing productivity to prioritize quality over quantity, and to encompass “invisible” work often shouldered by investigators with marginalized identities.

Drawing on these premises, we conducted preliminary research investigating the impact of death priming on CCD from the Terror management theory perspective. Methods and results: We administered a death priming task and measured CCD in its immediate wake or following a delay task. We confirmed among 219 Amazon’s MTurk participants that immediately following death priming, CCD was reduced among all participants. In the delayed death priming condition, we acquired preliminary evidence that CCD was heightened among Republican participants. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate the relevance of death priming to CCD tendencies and potentially spawn future research regarding CCD as a particular form of coping with existential threats."

Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Polarization dynamics around climate change are shifting from debates about the reality and severity of climate change to debates about climate solutions. We propose taking a value-based approach to understanding “climate-solutions polarization”. As a case study, we identified the discursive value expressions underlying the polarized biomass media discourse in the Netherlands, from 2019–2021. A discourse analysis showed how the value expressions (a) climate security, (b) environmental benevolence, and (c) local security produce an opposition discourse, whereas the value expressions (d) climate achievement, (e) technological security, and (f) economic security underpin advocacy discourse. We discuss how the strong presence of security values provides both communication opportunities and risks for transitioning to climate-resilient societies. Further, our research shows how both sides of the debate have scientific actors on their side using distinctive rhetorical strategies, providing insight into debates about the role of values in science. The value-based approach to understanding climate-solutions polarization is promising for both the science and practice of environmental communication."

Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.A second-order conspiracy (SOC) is a conspiracy that aims to create (and typically also disseminate) a conspiracy theory. Second-order conspiracy theories (SOCT) are theories that explain the occurrence of a given conspiracy theory by appeal to a conspiracy. In this paper I argue that SOC and SOCT are useful and coherent concepts, while also having numerous philosophically interesting upshots (in terms of epistemology, explanation, and prediction). Secondly, I appeal to the nature of two specific kinds of second-order conspiracies to make the case for what has been called ‘local generalism’ (Stamatiadis-Bréhier 2023a). Specifically, I focus on so-called ‘denial industries’ to argue that the structure of these second-order conspiracies allows us to infer non-accidental generalisations about the domain of conspiracy theories. Even though it is true that there is nothing epistemically problematic with the general class of conspiracy theories, there are specific subsets of conspiracy theories that warrant immediate strong suspicion (cf. Dentith 2022). By looking at the intricate mechanisms by which these denial industries operate, we can infer that the conspiracy theories that are produced by them are epistemically unwarranted. I conclude by making some exploratory remarks about what the metaphysics of second-order conspiracies would look like."

Although the novel, through temporal and spatial cues, portrays climate change as real and imminent, it also depicts characters in unacknowledged denial. By using Robert J. Lifton’s, Stanley Cohen’s, and Kari Marie Norgaard’s studies on denial as a theoretical tool, I illustrate how three levels of denial mirror each other: denial of climate change is closely related to denial of the loss of a daughter and denial of a tick bite. Furthermore, this article demonstrates that the structural and metaphorical features of the text—such as the reliance on the literary narratives of the flood and the pastoral, the widely anthropomorphized nature, and many biblical connotations—are aesthetic traits that support the thematic content and cement the nature-culture dichotomy. Hence, the novel appears to eradicate human agency and thereby any hope for change. The lack of distance between the characters and the narrative voice through the frequent use of free indirect discourse reinforces the pessimistic view."

We used Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning methods to embed the semantic meaning of the tweets into vectors, cluster the tweets, and analyze the results. We clustered the tweets into four clusters that correspond to four narratives in the discussion. Analyzing the behavioral dynamics of each cluster revealed that the clusters focus on the discussion of whether climate change is caused by humans or not, scientific arguments, policy, and conspiracy.

Strikingly, existing research on belief in misinformation about climate change has disproportionately focused on WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic) countries. To move beyond this, our online survey (N = 8541) includes high-income countries in North America (US), Western Europe (France, Germany, UK) and East Asia (Japan), as well as an upper-middle income country in South America (Brazil) and lower-middle income countries in South Asia (India and Pakistan). By examining the interplay of news media usage, information sources, and trust in these sources, we advance our understanding of how these factors influence belief in climate change-related misinformation in diverse socio-cultural contexts. Across countries, we found that the strongest determinants of belief in misinformation about climate change were identifying as right-wing (compared with left-wing), consuming less offline news, having less trust in scientists, environmental activists, as well as international organizations, and having more trust in politicians, celebrities, and energy companies. Overall, trust in sources of information about climate change and demographic variables were much stronger predictors of belief in misinformation about climate change than reported news consumption (online, offline or on social media). These findings suggest that trust is key to understanding belief in false information about climate change."

It approaches climate skepticism as a professional problem that involves a tension between conventional professional ideals that underscore balanced coverage of conflicts and emerging ideals that stress communicating climate change responsibly. Content analysis focused on two core forms of climate skepticism that have remained relatively stable throughout the 31-year research period: evidence and process skepticism. The presence of all kinds of skeptical contents (skeptical arguments, arguments against skepticism, and descriptions of skepticism) was examined to evalutate the overall media visibility of climate skepticism. The analysis then focused specifically on the coverage of skeptical arguments. The role of sources as well as the use of journalistic voice in the presentation of skeptical contents was examined. This study elaborates earlier anecdotal accounts concerning the limited public role of climate skepticism in Finland. Four per cent of news articles included sources who were quoted presenting their own skeptical views. Skeptical arguments were mainly presented by quoting foreign sources whereas arguments against skepticism were presented by quoting domestic climate scientists. “Climategate” caused the most notable increase in the volume of skeptical contents during the research period."

This article explores the use of the term “eco-fascism” in connection with the climate crisis and considers the political relationship between ecologism and the contemporary far right through a historical perspective, seeking to determine persisting patterns in the relationship between the far right and the environment. Section 1 travels back to the historical origins of this relationship between nationalism, fascism and the environment, arguing that the conceptions of nature adopted and nourished by fascism had scarcely anything to do with ecology in its contemporary meaning. Section 2 explores the most well-known and consolidated studies on the relationship between the far right and climate change denialism, identifying a broad consensus that unites scholars from various disciplines on the density, intensity and persistence of this political relationship in the current millennium. The article concludes by underlining the irreality, falsifiability and internal contradictions of the notion of “eco-fascism” at a time when right-wing regimes have seized power in many countries through the use of vocabularies and sentiments in defense of the territory and its resources, but with a substantial refusal to tackle global environmental problems."

While higher education institutions have embraced the rhetoric of sustainability and contributed to climate science, the development of renewables and other climate solutions, and a host of policy reforms that aim for greater sustainable development, this paper argues that particular forms of climate denial have impeded more transformative directions in higher education. These denials include denying the depth and magnitude of the problems that the planet and people around the world are facing, the unsustainability of continued limitless growth, and a denial of the contexts, legacies, and discourses that have often served to impede important reforms in higher education. Using a climate denial lens, this paper examines the role of different forms of denial in higher education, such as the role climate denial funding sources in universities and how historical legacies and modern neoliberal discourses continue to limit possibilities for more transformative reforms in higher education. The paper concludes by sharing how these forms of denial might be addressed to advance a stronger response to the climate crisis."

Despite a large body of literature on PRR environmentalism, however, the PRR’s climate politics remain understudied. This qualitative study investigates the climate politics of the PRR by analyzing climate discourse from Spain’s Vox party. A discourse analysis of party manifestos, press releases, and public statements from 2017–2022 investigates Vox’s discursive constructions of climate change and its potential solutions. The study finds that, although the party acknowledges climate change, it does so inconsistently, and its proposed climate policies do not fundamentally shift its nativist and populist political imagination. Instead, its discourse portrays multilateral climate action as a threat to the nation and locates climate solutions in the preservation of ruralism, traditional livelihoods, and national identity. The article argues that Vox constructs a nationalist climate discourse that reterritorializes climate change on the national level, asserts national innocence in the face of claims of global climate justice, and frames mainstream climate action as part of a broader globalist imposition that threatens the purity of national culture. The article concludes with reflections on what nationalist climate discourse may mean for attempts to mitigate the climate crisis."

While there is an overwhelming consensus among scientists that climate change is happening, recent surveys still indicate widespread climate change denial across societies. Given that corporate activity causing climate change is fundamentally rooted in individual beliefs and societal institutions, we examine whether local perceptions about climate change matter for firms’ engagement in environmental responsibility. We use climate change perception surveys conducted in the U.S. to compute a novel measure of climate change denial for each U.S. county. We find that firms located in counties with higher levels of climate change denial have weaker environmental performance ratings, are more likely to commit environmental violations, and impose greater environmental costs on society. Regional differences in religiosity, social capital, political leaning, or county-level demographic characteristics cannot explain these results. Furthermore, we document that strong corporate governance mechanisms and corporate culture moderate the negative relationship between climate change denial and corporate environmental responsibility. Overall, our findings offer new insights into how local beliefs and perceptions about climate change may influence firm-level sustainability practices."

In this paper, we examine process skepticism, a type of criticism that we argue is especially well-aligned with populism. Process skepticism focuses not on denying evidence of climate change (evidence skepticism) nor on critiquing policy responses (response skepticism), but on directly attacking the scientific and political processes underlying climate science and policy decision-making. We examine the prevalence of populist ideas in climate skeptical frames disseminated in U.S. media between 2008 and 2020. As expected, we find robust evidence of populist skepticism, particularly in far-right outlets. More importantly, the majority of populist messages were process skeptical in nature. The emergence of process skeptical populist frames may critically impede climate policy efforts by promoting distrust that is especially resistant to increasing scientific evidence or policy advancements."

We employed machine learning methods to analyze 452,167 climate change-related posts generated by 311,214 users from 2010 to 2020 on Weibo, finding that climate change discourse concentrated on environmental and health impacts and action advocacy, and misinformation was not prevalent. Regarding the composition of engaged users, only a small proportion were social bots which concentrated on action advocacy and politics and governance, rather than skeptical and denialist discourses. In terms of communication strategies, we found that social bots on Weibo were more likely to forward a post or mention another user than regular users.

WIREs Climate Change published by Wiley Periodicals LLC.Modern American members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (aka LDS or Mormons) are among the most environmentally skeptical American groups, but it has not always been this way. The church has an exceptionally robust eco-theology. In the 19th century, it espoused a strong “ethic of stewardship.” The review focuses on the story of how and why this shift from eco-theology to eco-skepticism occurred, shedding light on how theology, wider culture, and other forces can influence value creation, and how these changing values can transform the environmental attitudes and behaviors of an entire people. LDS eco-theology shares some principles in common with some other Christian faiths, but also includes a number of unique or unusual beliefs and egalitarian/agrarian practices. In the early church (19th century), eco-theology contributed to a value system which prioritized creation care. However, early LDS community land practices did not necessarily live up to these ideals and the local environment suffered serious consequences. Then, with an influx of external influences, including a growing population of non-LDS frontiersmen, Latter-day Saint values shifted away from creation care and egalitarianism and toward individualism and capitalism. Church leaders stopped regularly preaching about the earth's value, instead focusing on individual salvation. Environmental action antipathy and climate skepticism became the norm. This volte-face demonstrates both how theology can influence values and actions, and the inverse.

Character assassination against climate scientists and policymakers is the most common type of misinformation strategy used by contrarians in climate debates (Coan, T. G., Boussalis, C., Cook, J., & Nanko, M. O. (2021). Computer-assisted classification of contrarian claims about climate change. Scientific Reports, 11(1), 22320). Despite its widespread use, however, character assassination remains understudied by social scientists, especially in the context of climate change. This study adapts Douglas Walton’s (1998. Ad hominem arguments. University of Alabama Press) typology of ‘ad hominem’ attacks–personal attacks targeting an individual’s character, competence, or motives–to misinformation campaigns against the climate community. We developed an original codebook for classifying ad hominem arguments made by climate contrarians. Drawing on a 553-paragraph sample from a corpus from 55 contrarian blogs and 15 conservative think-tank websites published in English between 2008 and 2020, we then determined the relative prominence of each type of attack using a consensus-coding approach. Bias attacks, which entail accusing climate scientists of political partisanship or having an ideological agenda, were the most common form of contrarian ad hominem attack. The dominance of bias attacks can be explained by their strong relevance for scientific credibility. The study found that ad hominem attacks, often with bias and moral attacks clustered together, are the most common combination. The article concludes by discussing the implications of these findings for climate policy and future research. Key Policy Insights Climate misinformation politicizes climate science, further amplifying ideological conflict and fostering ideological polarization; Climate misinformation campaigns feature a range of different types of ad hominem attacks designed to undermine the credibility of climate scientists; The most common type of ad hominem attack on climate scientists in our sample was bias attacks, which entail accusing climate scientists of political partisanship or of having an ideological agenda; Attacks on the moral character of climate scientists were the only type of ad hominem that increased during the period under study (2008–2020); Different types of ad hominems often appeared together, with the most common combination being bias and moral attacks; Ad hominem attacks on climate scientists are part of misinformation campaigns designed to stall discussion on climate change and delay the implementation of climate policies."

Specifically, we use data gathered from 1,000 surveys with skeptics in the U.S. Pacific Northwest to present an analysis of how trust in institutions and institutional leaders affect the relationship between skeptics’ information sources and their type/strength of skepticism along a “continuum” of skeptical thought. Results reveal that the reliance on conservative/rightwing media and trust in actors steeped within the climate change denial countermovement is associated with a higher degree of denial of anthropogenic climate change as opposed to doubt of the phenomenon. Further, skeptics’ reliance on non-scientific sources for climate change information is partly explained by their distrust in climate scientists."

However, some research suggests that when numerate people hold extreme worldviews they could use their skills to engage in motivated (biased) reasoning about controversial topics like climate change, further polarizing their judgments and beliefs. While suggestive, previous numeracy studies on this topic have neglected the highly influential role of knowledge in skilled judgment and decision making (see Skilled Decision Theory; Cokely et al., 2018). To address this limit, we conducted two studies with diverse (n = 537) and probabilistically representative samples (n = 305) of U.S. residents, testing the first integrated cognitive model of the relations between numeracy, worldviews, knowledge, beliefs, and risk perceptions. Structural modeling revealed that regardless of people’s worldviews, numeracy was not associated with polarization or enhanced bias. However, numeracy was consistently related to more accurate climate change knowledge, which was by far the strongest predictor of accurate beliefs (e.g., 6–10 times stronger than people’s worldviews), largely mediating the associations between worldviews and risk perceptions (e.g., individualists were less informed and less concerned about climate change). Consistent with the risk literacy Knowledge is Power account, results suggest that when accurate risk knowledge is available numeracy skills may generally promote more informed and therefore less biased judgment and decision making, even when people are confronted with controversies and conflicts of interest."

This article examines self-declared climate change skeptics’ views of clean energy policy along a continuum of skeptical thought, spanning from epistemic denial to attribution doubt. To perform this, we use data from an online survey administered in the US Pacific Northwest and a series of pilot interviews conducted with skeptics in the same region. Results reveal that skeptics’ support for clean energy policy is consistently linked with their environmental concern across the skepticism continuum. Conspiracy ideation and distrust in science lead to a reduction in support. However, the positive effect of environmental concern trumps the effects of these beliefs. Important and hopeful implications of these findings for climate change communication and policy are discussed."

To do so, we conducted a cross-sectional survey (N = 361) in which we assessed different (social) identities, efficacy beliefs, climate change denial, and pro-environmental actions. Results suggest that while environmentalist and global identities significantly predicted climate change denial, country identity did not. Environmentalist and country identities predicted collective efficacy, however, only environmentalist identity predicted participatory efficacy. Private pro-environmental behaviour was positively predicted by environmentalist and country identities; participation in collective action was positively predicted by environmentalist identity and negatively predicted by country identity. In addition, identification with environmentalist and global identities was positively associated with collective action through climate change denial and also participatory efficacy belief.

However, the potential perils of open data are seldom examined and discussed in equal measure to these promises. As we continue to invest in open data, we need to study the full spectrum of what open data facilitates in practice, which can then inform future policy and design decisions. This paper aims to address this gap by presenting an investigative digital ethnography of one contrarian community, anthropogenic climate change (ACC) skeptics, to describe how they process, analyze, preserve, and share data. Skeptics often engage in data reuse similar to conventional data reusers, albeit for unconventional purposes and with varying degrees of trust and expertise. The data practices of ACC skeptics challenge the assumption that open data is universally beneficial. These findings carry implications for data repositories and how they might curate data and design databases with this type of reuse in mind."

Identifying misinformation and investigating its characteristics are of great importance to counteract misinformation. Therefore, this study aims to characterize the semantic features (frames and authority references) of climate change misinformation in the context of Chinese social media. Posts concerning climate change were collected from Weibo between January 2010 and December 2020. First, veracity, frames, and authority references were manually labeled. Then, we applied logistic regression to examine the relationship between information veracity and semantic features. The results revealed that posts concerning environmental and health impact and science and technology were more likely to be misinformation. Moreover, posts referencing non-specific authority sources are more likely to be misinformed than posts making no references to any authority references. This study provides a theoretical understanding of the semantic characteristics of climate change misinformation and practical suggestions for combating them."

We conducted a public consultation involving almost 500 citizens and addressed controversial science-related topics. Discussions were qualitatively content analyzed. The public consultations revealed the prevalence of traditional media as a source of scientific information, and the results presented a general perception of inadequate, imprecise, and insufficient scientific communication.

There is formative knowledge about the role of political propaganda in climate policies and resulting outcomes. To contribute to the understanding of political ideology and the extent of CCD, we adopt econometric techniques to study the impact of the United States of America's withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. The results show that ideological political propaganda has psychological and philosophical consequences that impact climate change policies. In addition, we find that the effect of a state's economic growth on climate change is mediated by CCD. In particular, low-income capitalist states have a higher propensity to become CCDs because they are more likely to engage in economic expansion even at the expense of environmental sustainability. Global climate change policies depend on high-income nations and industries' willingness to adopt economic policies to achieve sustainable future development. Thus, this study fills the literature gap on the relationship between political ideology and climate change. The findings show that CCD significantly influences voting patterns and socioeconomic outcomes. It impedes states from achieving net-zero emissions and carbon neutrality and it is used as a political propaganda. Subject to these findings, relevant policy suggestions are offered."

Methods: We study survey data from the 2020 American National Election Study. We examine respondents’ endorsement of misinformation on different scientific issues and their reported confidence in these views. Results: We find that racial resentment plays a strong role in leading Americans to hold confidently misinformed views about highly racialized policy issues (e.g., the occurrence of anthropogenic climate change or the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic), but not on less racialized issues (e.g., childhood vaccine safety). Conclusions: Our work underscores the often-overlooked importance of intergroup attitudes in shaping overconfidence and helps resolve theoretical tensions in the study of misinformation acceptance."

However, existing measures vary considerably. In this paper, we address the differences and limitations of existing measures of CCS and present a new measure. In three studies (n = 534; n = 352; n = 252), we examined the factor structure, test-retest reliability, and associations with intentions for sustainable behaviors, psychological resistance to change, and dispositional tendencies for motivated reasoning. The resulting climate change skepticism questionnaire (CCS-Q) is a 12-item scale that assesses four dimensions of CCS: trend, attribution, impact, and response skepticism. The CCS-Q combines expressions of doubt or uncertainty with denial. The studies we conducted support our four-dimensional structure and test-retest reliability was good. Furthermore, CCS-Q scores were negatively related to intentions for sustainable behavior and positively related to resistance to change. We did not find any association with motivated reasoning. Overall, the new CCS-Q offers a reliable and valid measure for CCS."

We theorize that climate change-related anger and political environmental activism can explain why people chose to correct others on social media. We further assume reciprocal relationships in which the act of correcting others predicts anger and political environmental activism. By doing so, we extend the concept of expression effects of correcting others from a cognitive level that predicts activism to an affective level (i.e., predicting anger). Structural equation modeling using data from a two-wave panel survey (N = 549) showed reciprocal relations between political environmental activism and correcting perceived climate change misinformation. Correction was further positively related to climate change-related anger, which, in turn, was positively related to political environmental activism. The data showed neither support for climate change-related anger predicting correction nor for political environmental activism predicting anger. This paper discusses the proposed extension of expression effects to an affective level in the context of misinformation research."

As we will demonstrate through a case study of Aotearoa New Zealand’s 2021 ‘Groundswell’ protests, locally-based influencers and ‘alt-media’ platforms have disseminated conspiracist, unscientific narratives on both COVID and global warming to audiences likely to be receptive to these associations. The authors identify some of the tropes and narratives circulated by influencers during the demonstrations as bearing the fingerprints of radical right-wing discourse originating in the United States. The case is made that there is a high degree of cross-pollination of ideas at play within the phenomenon of anti-authority, conspiracist protest movements in Aotearoa, of which ‘Groundswell’ was an instructive example (uniting rural protesters with anti-vaccine demagogues); the discourse is infused with emotionally potent falsehoods and American-style ‘culture wars’ language. While these narratives remain relatively fringe, their toxic messaging may become more influential as more people turn to ‘alt-media’ sources for news. Indeed, the extent to which some of the influencers and language from this movement are edging closer to the outer boundaries of mainstream media and politics may represent an early warning sign for the future trajectory of this phenomenon. Finally, the authors tentatively pose some recommendations for professional media engagement with the growth of ‘viral’ content that misrepresents criti-cal social challenges."

The aim of this article is to identify the climate change imaginaries that are constructed and circulated in the Watts Up With That? Facebook group, and the narratives that are used to sustain them discursively. By means of an analysis of group posts and discussions, I show that these nurture a skeptical discourse in which a few recurrent themes create a polarized moral landscape, and are discussed in an environment of self-legitimization and rejection of the official scientific discourse. As my main conclusion, I propose that climate change denial represents a defense of the status quo, and constructs an environmental imaginary which is based on the separation between human beings and nature, and on the Enlightenment narrative of infinite progress."

The present article aimed to answer the question: What leads people to deny even the strongest evidence and distrust the scientific method? The article provides a narrative review of research on the underpinnings of science denial, with the main focus on climate change denial. Perspectives that are commonly studied separately are integrated. We review key findings on the roles of disinformation and basic cognitive processes, motivated reasoning (focusing on ideology and populism), and emotion regulation in potentially shaping (or not shaping) views on science and scientific topics. We also include research on youth, a group in an important transition phase in life that is the future decision-makers but less commonly focused on in the research field. In sum, we describe how the manifestations of denial can stem from cognitive biases, motivating efforts to find seemingly rational support for desirable conclusions, or attempts to regulate emotions when feeling threatened or powerless. To foster future research agendas and mindful applications of the results, we identify some research gaps (most importantly related to crosscultural considerations) and examine the unique features or science denial as an object of psychological research. Based on the review, we make recommendations on measurement, science communication, and education."

The paper answers the research question whether the Hungarian populist right’s narrative reactions differed from non-incumbent populist parties and movements, and to what extent the populist discourse defined these reactions. The paper analyses the content of the conservative, nationally circulated daily newspaper Magyar Nemzet and the government’s press releases between the 2018 general election and November 2020, the onset of the second wave of the Covid-19 in Hungary. The analyses of the identified frames (N = 171) demonstrate that the climate movement was interpreted as the new left, and political interests were suspected of supporting the movement in the background. The accusation of serving hidden political and economic interests and being a new form of the political left served the effort to discredit the climate movement. The results also indicate that the narrative reaction of the Hungarian populist right followed the general communication and policy agenda of the Hungarian government, rather than the inherent discursive patterns of populism. It could be rightly assumed that this interrelation is the consequence of the incumbency and strong centralization of the populist right in Hungary."

Despite the data and general consen-sus in the scientific community, the climate change debate is highly polarized, with skeptical voices denying or questioning climate change and using social media to amplify the reach of their message. This can encourage misinformation and polarization. This study tries to identify the key indicators of social skepticism around climate change through the analysis of users’ social activism and behavioral patterns on Twitter. We analyze keywords, frequency, topics, and categories from a sample of 78,168 tweets. The results show, first, that there is an overlap of topics, with 24 of the 28 topics grouped in the intertopic distance map; second, that the size of the topics is relatively small and linked to specific events; and, third, that there is a significant political presence, especially from the United States.

Unfortunately, little is known about its emergence and early psychological underpinnings. To address this issue, the present study examined the links between basic values and climate change skepticism in young adolescents from three culturally, socially, and politically diverse countries. In an online survey, adolescents (N = 5,244, ages 12–14) from the Netherlands, China, and Colombia reported their basic values and levels of climate change skepticism. In each country, adolescents who reported elevated levels of climate change skepticism prioritized self-enhancement values (and, to a lesser degree, openness-to-change values), but not self-transcendence values. Latent Profile Analyses identified 5 value priority profiles, and similarly showed that adolescents with self-focused value priority profiles reported higher levels of climate change skepticism than adolescents with other-focused value priority profiles. Together, our findings show that, across countries, early emerging climate change skepticism is linked to value profiles that promote self-interest over collective welfare. These findings suggest opportunity for intervention in early adolescence, when adolescents’ budding values and views on polarized topics such as climate change may be relatively malleable."

Public online conversations that reflect on these events as climate emergencies can create awareness and build support for climate action but are also used to spread misinformation and climate change denial. To what extent automated social media accounts—“social bots”—amplify different perspectives of such events and influence climate change discourses, remains unknown, however. We use Twitter and the 2019/2020 Australia bushfires as a case study to explore this issue. Utilizing more than 1 million Tweets, we identify how climate change is framed in the context of those fires, and to what extent social bots affect specific climate change frames, including the spread of misinformation. Our results show that climate change represents a substantial part of online conversations about fires. The bushfires are primarily framed as a climate change issue including its measurable impacts and political perspectives. Climate denial represents a small share of this conversation and receives limited amplification. Social bots seemingly contribute to the climate change conversation, both through frames that support and oppose climate action, and amplify to larger degree frames appealing to emotions, such as sympathy or humor. We also find that Twitter discussions about the role of social bots in spreading climate denial are amplified more than actual climate-critical frames propagated by bots. A complex interplay between social bots, Twitter conversations, and online news media is emerging, which shapes discussions about climate change and wildfires."

We argue that one common element is the wealth of basic and applied scientific research that provides the knowledge and tools essential in developing effective programs for addressing threats to humans and social-ecological systems. Research on various chemicals, including dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, resulted in regulatory action to protect environmental and human health. Moreover, decades of research on coronaviruses, mRNA, and recently SARS-CoV-2 enabled the rapid development of vaccines to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. In the present study, we explore the common elements of basic and applied scientific research breakthroughs that link chemicals, climate change, and SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 and describe how scientific information was applied for protecting human health and, more broadly, socio-ecological systems. We also offer a cautionary note on the misuse and mistrust of science that is not new in human history, but unfortunately is surging in modern times. Our goal was to illustrate the critical role of scientific research to society, and we argue that research must be intentionally fostered, better funded, and applied appropriately. To that end, we offer evidence that supports the importance of investing in scientific research and, where needed, ways to counter the spread of misinformation and disinformation that undermines legitimate discourse.

Numerous scholarly efforts have been devoted to automatic misinformation detection to address this problem. The effective feature is the key to achieving high identification performance. However, the effectiveness of the feature may change in different issues and time considering the manifold social contextual reasons. Most extant literature on misinformation detection does not differentiate between topics, issues or domains. Although some research compares detection across domains, they concentrate on the model's overall performance, neglecting the effectiveness of individual features. Furthermore, the comparison studies mainly incorporate single-domain issues rather than issues that cover multiple domains. It is still difficult to determine which domain's misinformation characteristics will match those of multi-dimensional issues. Since the misinformation nowadays covers multiple domains, finding robust features in misinformation detection over issues and time is an urgent research agenda. In this study, we collected datasets of two issues, climate change and genetically modified organisms (GMOs), between January 1st, 2010 and December 31st, 2020 on Weibo, manually annotated the veracity status of the posts, and compared the performance of the proposed features in identifying misinformation by applying logistic regression. The results demonstrate that (1) the predicting power of content-based features, including topic and sentiment, is relatively robust compared to user-based and propagation-based features across issues and time. (2) The feature effectiveness varied at different time points. Our findings imply that future research could consider focusing more on content-based features, especially implicit features from the content in misinformation detection. Moreover, researchers should evaluate the feature effectiveness at different time stages to improve the efficiency of misinformation detection."

In much of this prior work, white identity is treated as a categorical label, limiting the theoretical and empirical understanding of this relationship. Drawing on survey data from a US national sample of 933 white young adults, we theorize that white identity is a developmental process where people explore the meanings of their racial identity and commit to a white identity marked by enhanced levels of social dominance orientation and conspiratorial ideation, two social-psychological constructs consistently associated with climate change skepticism. Using regression analyses, we tested a mediation model that a strong white identity would increase climate change skepticism by enhancing one’s social dominance orientation and conspiratorial ideation. We found partial support for our model. While a strong white identity was positively associated with social dominance orientation and conspiratorial ideation, only social dominance orientation increased climate change skepticism. Conspiratorial ideation reduced climate change skepticism. We discuss the implications of our findings for the climate change literature as well as how our findings can inform policies that could reduce climate change skepticism among white people."

The omnipresent specter of climate change and global warming cannot be processed by individual psyches because there is little – if anything – that individual people can do to stop the devastation that hovers on the horizon. Unlike other disasters and calamities that have affected humans (war, genocide, nuclear destruction, pandemics, despotism) climate change presents unique challenges to the human psyche as it engages traumatic temporality on a global scale. The inexorably real threat of climate change threatens the psyche’s ability to establish a rational relation to reality. The scale and speed of the catastrophic destruction underway calls for a reconsideration of the force and quality of the denial that accompanies it. Some of the most ‘wellmeaning’ forms of denial may turn out to be the most insidious as they attempt to rationalize, humanize and normalize actions and events that ought to force us to reckon with what we cannot bear to know."

This work encourages theoretical movement beyond the scientific and political disembodiment that often characterises contemporary climate change denial discourse, and urges greater attention to the sensory drivers of climate-related behaviours, experiences, and perceptions. This sensory approach may allow theoretical and strategic engagement with otherwise hidden social barriers to sustainable climate interventions and action."

In this paper I attempt to understand why, in important sectors of contemporary philosophy, the climate crisis has actually failed to effect a meaningful transformation. In particular, I note that the observed changes in the field of normative political philosophy, for which one might expect climate breakdown to be especially disruptive, have in fact been quite modest. I argue that an expanded model of climate denialism – one that understands denialism concerning the existence of climate change and denialism concerning its structural causes and political-theoretical entailments as two species with a common underlying source – can help to explain this gap between the current state of normative political philosophy and the exigencies of our planetary reality."

Despite the paramount importance of climate science in identifying and describing the challenge of climate change, climate policies cannot be “read off” scientific research, nor can expertise replace democratic debate. However, given the built-in opportunities it provides for voicing dissent and the need to compromise to pass legislation, democracy itself might become an obstacle to taking the bold action needed to tackle an unprecedented challenge like anthropogenic climate change. This chapter probes the intersection between science and decision-making by focusing on the role of experts in modern democracies. It outlines three conceptualizations of scientific expertise-informative, communicative, and competitive-and discusses their respective implications for democratic participation on climate politics; it also highlights the possible tension between appropriate political action and legitimate political action."

However, such passivity increases the risk of climate impacts so severe as to threaten the persistence of organized society, and thus HEIs themselves. This paper explores why a maladaptive cognitive-practice gap persists and asks what steps could be taken by members of HEIs to activate the academy. Drawing on insights from climate psychology and sociology, we argue that a process of ‘socially organized denial’ currently exists within universities, leading academics to experience a state of ‘double reality’ that inhibits feelings of accountability and agency, and this is self-reenforcing through the production of ‘pluralistic ignorance.’ We further argue that these processes serve to uphold the cultural hegemony of ‘business-as-usual’ and that this is worsened by the increasing neo-liberalization of modern universities. Escaping these dynamics will require deliberate efforts to break taboos, through frank conversations about what responding to a climate emergency means for universities’ – and individual academics’ – core values and goals."

The results showed that the most common reason for being at least somewhat worried was concern about the consequences of climate change. Respondents reporting high worry were in particular more likely to bring up consequences for humans than those reporting medium worry. Respondents who reported low worry referred to a broader range of reasons in their answers, such as believing in natural rather than human causes of climate change, expressing a sense of optimism towards potential solutions, or being discontent with political measures or public discourse on climate change. These findings add novel insights into understanding the subjective meaning associated with the degree to which people report being worried about climate change."

In this study, we investigate how maps have been incorporated into climate change communication in conservative media. Our research has two major findings. First, compared to mainstream media, conservative media is far less likely to use maps in reporting on climate change. We call this lack of maps a “cartographic silence,” borrowing and expanding on Harley’s term. Second, when conservative media uses maps, never do they create their own maps to accompany false arguments. Instead, these maps are republished from other media or peer-reviewed science, and reframed by logical fallacies. We conclude by offering suggestions about how scientists can improve their maps in hopes that they will be less susceptible to use in conservative disinformation efforts."

By piggy-backing on the open access (OA) movement and taking advantage of the “publish or perish” culture in a system that prioritises quantity over quality, predatory publishing has grown exponentially in recent years and spread across all areas of knowledge. Thousands of predatory journals and books have emerged and (provided a fee is paid) they publish scientific papers and chapters without submitting them to rigorous peer review. Now there are even predatory meetings, which promise to accept talks and publish complete works for a fee, also without reviewing them properly. These profit-making machines can damage both academia and society, putting at risk the quality of science and public trust in it, the well-being of the population, the conservation of biodiversity and the mitigation of climate change. We show the modus operandi behind invitations to contribute to predatory journals, books and meetings and suggest ways to separate the wheat from the chaff. Finally, we discuss the need to create regulatory agencies that perform a careful and systematic evaluation of the activities carried out by publishers."

Inoculation theory has shown to be a promising vehicle to effectively neutralise the influence of misinformation on adults in various contexts. However, possible applications of inoculation theory for climate change education with young people have not been looked at yet. In this study, we investigated whether Austrian adolescents can be “inoculated” against misinformation targeted at the scientific consensus regarding climate change. In a quantitative randomised online survey experiment (N = 1066) based on the study of van der Linden et al. (Global Challenges 1(2):1600008, 2017), we demonstrated that adolescents are susceptible to presented misinformation targeted at the scientific consensus regarding climate change, even in the presence of accurate information. However, it is possible to pre-emptively protect adolescents against such misinformation through attitudinal inoculation. Furthermore, the inoculation treatment led to not only an increase in the adolescents’ consensus estimate but also their belief certainty in their estimate increased. We recommend future climate change education research to further elaborate possible applications of inoculation theory in climate change education or when teaching other supposedly socially controversial topics."

In this paper, for understanding the roots of skepticism, by adopting a postmodern approach to the related discourses, the footprint of forming a metanarrative was seen. To avoid the pitfalls, deconstruction suggests that that the first thing to do is to acknowledge the ambiguity of that definition that comes from the inefficiency of using the binary oppositions - the needs and ambitions, and the present and future generations - and holding to its constructive narrative; limitation. The second step is creating a more engaging narrative of sustainable development. Talking about ""a climate crisis with force and fury""is the new narrative that President Biden has started.

The analysis also identifies a low-priority audience category of climate justice deniers, or people who—independent of their views on the climate crisis itself—are apathetic to its social justice implications.

This chapter contributes to the scant literature on climate change governance and populism by arguing that right-wing populism’s ‘critique’ of climate capitalism is an integral part of the capitalist system that sustains market approaches and inequalities that emerge from it to tackle climate change. While right-wing populists focus on climate denial and the negative impact of environmental regulation on the those ‘left behind’, supporters of climate capitalism consolidate neoliberal climate change governance (CCG) as the only politically viable option to tackle the climate emergency. Both approaches are essentially elitist, in the sense that they have a clear track record of supporting extractive and financial business elites, while creating historically unprecedented inequalities and injustices around the world. While right-wing populism focuses on climate denial discourses, posing CCG as a threat to national sovereignty and the economy, the marketization of climate change is in denial of the need for deep transformations within capitalism. Consequently, this double movement enables the extractive and financial businesses elites to thrive, posing a continued and real danger to the climate crisis."

First, to bring together recent studies in this debate, taxonomizing different ways of thinking about the epistemic status of echo chambers. Second, to consider and reject several accounts of what makes echo chambers epistemically harmful or not, and then offer an alternative account which builds on some features of existing accounts. In our view, echo chambers–even those that are truth-conducive–are always epistemically harmful because of their reasons-undermining features, e.g. the way that they impede the development of epistemic reasons which can answer and withstand challenges. This account captures important ideas behind several theories in the epistemology of echo chambers, but offers a richer explanation that does not suffer from their limitations."

From global warming to the spread of misinformation and beyond, our species is facing several major challenges that are the result of the limits of our own reasoning and decision-making. So, why are we so prone to errors during reasoning? In this chapter, I will outline a framework for understanding reasoning errors that is based on a three-stage dual-process model of analytic engagement (intuition, metacognition, and reason). The model has two key implications: (1) That a mere lack of deliberation and analytic thinking is a primary source of errors and (2) That when deliberation is activated, it generally reduces errors (via questioning intuitions and integrating new information) and rarely increases errors (via rationalization and motivated reasoning). In support of these claims, I review research showing the extensive predictive validity of measures that index individual differences in analytic cognitive style—even beyond explicit errors per se. In particular, analytic thinking is not only predictive of skepticism about a wide range of epistemically suspect beliefs (paranormal, conspiratorial, COVID-19 misperceptions, pseudoscience and alternative medicines) as well as decreased susceptibility to bullshit, fake news, and misinformation, but also important differences in people's moral judgments and values as well as their religious beliefs (and disbeliefs). Furthermore, in some (but not all cases), there is evidence from experimental paradigms that support a causal role of analytic thinking in determining judgments, beliefs, and behaviors. The findings reviewed here provide some reason for optimism for the future: It may be possible to foster analytic thinking and therefore improve the quality of our decisions."

However, the seriousness of the problem does not preclude non-serious solutions. There are numerous potential benefits to humor as a strategy to counter misinformation, such as attracting attention and engaging disengaged audiences. This paper describes a humorous serious game—“Cranky Uncle”—developed in the U.S. to inoculate players against climate misinformation. The game combines psychological research into active inoculation, critical-thinking work on misleading rhetorical techniques, communication research into cartoon debunking, and gamification. The game’s cartoon humor and the creative potential of active inoculation lends it to classroom applications; educators have thus used classroom activities to complement the game in order to improve students’ climate literacy and critical-thinking abilities. We present several qualitative U.S.-based case studies, in formal English-speaking tertiary classrooms and informal public education settings, to illustrate the utility of a humorous, game-based approach to building resilience against climate misinformation. The approaches adopted in our case studies are offered as a model for other educators looking to use interactive games to teach critical thinking."

As most social media users share articles solely relying on the headline, this raises the question of how emerging digital media reporting–especially in the headlines–shapes the perception of climate change issues and engages audiences. Guided by the dual-systems emotion model and discrete-emotions model, this study compared emotion words used in headlines versus full text among climate change articles–and their social media engagement, using computational methods. Findings suggested that climate change support headlines were more likely to use fear words while denial headlines were significantly more likely to contain emotion words, negatively-valenced words, as well as words for anger, anticipation, disgust, sadness, and surprise. Regarding the full text, denial articles were more likely to contain emotion words, negatively-valenced words, and many discrete emotions related words than support articles. A denial article’s engagement was predicted by the total number of emotion words contained in its headline, whereas a support article’s engagement was predicted by negatively-valenced words and words for fear used in its headline. Emotions contained in the full text did not predict support and -denial articles’ engagement. Findings provide practical guidance on how to increase the engagement level of climate change articles."

We report three studies on a psychological framework derived from integrated threat theory—a psychological theory which describes how perceived threat leads to group polarization and prejudice—composed of the following constructs: group belongingness, perceived threat, outgroup derogation, and intergroup anxiety. Our pilot study suggested that need to belong and intergroup anxiety predict antiscientific beliefs (pseudoscientific, paranormal, and conspiracy theories), thus justifying the general applicability of integrated threat theory. Study 1 investigates the transition from weak to strong critical thinking regarding pseudoscientific doctrines. Besides greater outgroup derogation and perceived threats among strong critical thinkers, the model does not perform well in this context. Study 2 focuses on the intergroup conflict around anthropogenic global warming, revealing the strong predictive power of the model.

Accordingly, we surveyed 582 women (224 pregnant) using a questionnaire and constructed a moderated mediation model to explore the relationships among individuals’ bullshit receptivity, belief in misinformation about climate change, willingness to share misinformation about climate change, and pregnancy. The results showed that: (1) bullshit receptivity is positively related to the willingness to share misinformation about climate change; (2) belief in misinformation about climate change mediates the relationship between bullshit receptivity and willingness to share misinformation about climate change; and (3) for individuals with higher bullshit receptivity, pregnancy exacerbates the detrimental effects of bullshit receptivity on belief in misinformation about climate change."

The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and the Chi-square test. The findings revealed that politicians, organizations, and anonymous agencies use more strategies to deny climate change compared with other agents such as academics, business tycoons, and celebrities. Additionally, social media, broadcast media, and online news represent the most frequently used platforms to deny climate change. These outcomes suggest the critical role of politics in sabotaging the efforts against climate change disinformation.

We examined 188 documents on climate change authored by organizations in and affiliated with the utility industry from 1968 to 2019. Before 1980, electric utilities’ messaging was generally in-line with the scientific understanding of climate change. However, from 1990 to 2000, utility organizations founded and funded front groups that promoted climate doubt and denial. After 2000, these front groups were largely shut down, and utility organizations shifted to arguing for delayed action on climate change, by highlighting the responsibility of other sectors and promoting actions other than cleaning up the electricity system. Overall, our results suggest that electric utility industry organizations have promoted messaging designed to avoid taking action on reducing pollution over multiple decades. Notably, many of the utilities most engaged in communicating climate doubt and denial in the past currently have the slowest plans to decarbonize their electricity mix."

Political Psychology published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of International Society of Political Psychology.This research examines the relationship between populist thinking and global crisis-solving motivations concerning climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic. Using data from five European countries (Switzerland, France, Finland, Greece, and Italy), we test a model where crisis-related science skepticism—understood as the defense of commonsense knowledge against scientific expertise—mediates the association between populist thinking and crisis-mitigation attitudes. The results show considerable convergence across national contexts. Relative deprivation predicts endorsement of two core components of populism's thin ideology, people sovereignty and antielitism. These subdimensions of populism are linked to science skepticism, although variably across contexts. Science skepticism then leads to a lower sense of personal responsibility for climate change mitigation and to negative attitudes towards a governmental measure to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings further show that under specific conditions, the populist request for greater democratic participation may mobilize individuals to get involved in crisis mitigation. Overall, our results highlight the role of politicized common sense in motivating and justifying opposition to measures and policies based on scientific expertise. We conclude that science skepticism, rather than populism per se, explains cynical and dismissive attitudes towards global crises."

Results: Evidence is presented of a deepening gap between scientists and the general public on several key issues. Evidence is presented of a decline in science aspirations among youth and in educational achievement in general in the United States. If these events are accurate, they are ones that may widen the divide further. Conclusion: Some examples for improving the communication of science are presented.

When this process is focused on a well-established subject such as climate change, it can subvert measures and policies that various governmental bodies have taken to mitigate the phenomenon. It is therefore essential to effectively identify and counteract fake news on climate change. To do this, our main contribution represents a novel dataset with more than 2300 articles written in French, gathered using web scraping from all types of media dealing with climate change. Manual labeling was performed by two annotators with three classes: “fake”, “biased”, and “true”. Machine Learning models ranging from bag-of-words representations used by an SVM to Transformer-based architectures built on top of CamemBERT were built to automatically classify the articles. Our results, with an F1-score of 84.75% using the BERT-based model at the article level coupled with hand-crafted features specifically tailored for this task, represent a strong baseline. At the same time, we highlight perceptual properties as text sequences (i.e., fake, biased, and irrelevant text fragments) at the sentence level, with a macro F1 of 45.01% and a micro F1 of 78.11%.

This is especially because climate change still represents a (socially) controversial topic and students may be confronted with misrepresentations and misinformation about climate change in their daily lives. Therefore, it is important that science teachers are equipped with skills to properly respond to or “debunk” climate change misinformation, and to train their students on how to identify and respond to misinformation. To address this, we developed an intervention based on inoculation theory and known debunking techniques to foster physics pre-service teachers’ debunking skills as well as their self-efficacy to confront climate misinformation. Through the intervention, we showed that the participants increased their debunking skills and they showed more accurate assessments of their own skills. We conclude that this approach is promising to foster pre-service teachers’ perceived competence to teach the demanding topic of climate change.

This study aimed at furthering the understanding of psychological functions of climate denial by 1) exploring potential distinct profiles of climate denial and 2) investigating relations with right-wing ideological conviction and gender (established predictors) but also need satisfaction and value orientation. Latent profile analysis of a German quota sample (N = 1007) revealed differences in the extent to which participants endorsed all types of climate denial but revealed no distinct profiles. As pre-registered, structural equation modeling revealed that people who reported right-wing ideological convictions reported all types of climate denial more, especially literal and interpretive denial. Absence of need satisfaction and male gender were additional, weaker predictors of implicatory denial. These findings suggest that climate denial may protect the self from both loss of privilege and the experience of uncomfortable emotions when psychological resources are scarce. Future research should employ longitudinal, experimental, mixed-methods designs to further disentangle the underlying mechanisms of climate denial."

Using a unique data set from an online survey of 1,000 adults in the U.S. Pacific Northwest who are uncertain or skeptical of anthropogenic climate change, we explore the diversity of environmental concerns, environmental behaviors, and support for pro-environmental policy within and among those who do not accept climate science. Our results reveal statistically significant and consistent positive effects of (negative) environmental experiences on climate change skeptics’ environmental concerns, behaviors, and policy support. We also find that, among climate skeptics, religious ideation, conspiracy ideation, science distrust, political ideology (conservative), and gender (men) are negatively associated with certain pro-environmental attitudes, behaviors, and support for pro-environmental policy initiatives. We discuss the implications of these findings for climate change and science communication, environmental campaigns, and policy development."

The solution to this problem, many have argued, begins with teaching environmentalism in primary and secondary schools and fostering receptivity to environmental issues and environmental science among the next generation. This strategy, of course, comes with its own set of challenges. Where does climate change fit in the school curriculum? What can teachers do in their classrooms to mitigate the influence of partisan politics? How can an abstract global phenomenon be made real at the local level? If K-12 education has a role to play in the broader project of environmental conservation, such questions need to be answered. For this Policy Dialogue, the HEQ editors asked Zeke Baker and Hunter Gehlbach to explore the challenges and opportunities inherent in educating the next generation about climate change, drawing on analogues from the past and scholarship from the present to help us better understand the future. Gehlbach is a professor and vice dean at the Johns Hopkins University School of Education. Thanks to a mid-career fellowship from the Spencer Foundation, much of his research focus has shifted toward investigating how social psychological approaches might improve environmental education. Baker is an assistant professor of sociology at Sonoma State University. His research explores the development and use of climate science, especially insofar as climate knowledge is embedded in social relationships of power.

Method: Participants were randomly assigned to one of the three conditions: a control condition (no training); a passive inoculation condition; or an active inoculation condition. Participants completed demographic questions followed by training or no training and then evaluated a misinformation and factual article for reliability and persuasiveness. Results: Participants in the active inoculation condition rated the reliability and persuasiveness of the misinformation article and the reliability of the factual article lower than participants in the control condition. Participants in the passive inoculation training did not rate the reliability and persuasiveness of a misinformation and factual article significantly differently to those in the control condition. When factors such as ideological worldview and climate change beliefs were controlled for however, the inoculation interventions had no significant effect on ratings of reliability and persuasiveness for a misinformation or factual article. Conclusion: Inoculation seems to be a promising method of preventing the acceptance of misinformation on climate science. However, this analysis highlights that more investigation is required in order to determine the most effective inoculation training design."

In this study, we contribute to the debate by examining reactions to opposing views within a major climate change skeptic online community on “Reddit.” A large sample of posts (N = 3000) was manually coded according to whether they were opposed to climate skepticism or not, which allowed the automated classification of the full dataset of more than 50,000 posts, with codes inferred from linked websites. We find that confrontation with opposing views triggered activity in the forum, particularly among users who are highly engaged with the community. Those engaging with such views were also more likely to comment again. In other words, light engagement with opposition reinforced the community we study, rather than undermining it. Considering our findings, defensive or preventive policies appear more promising than strategies to actively counter systematic and persistent skepticism of scientific issues."

Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Studies of climate discourse on social media platforms often find evidence of polarization, echo chambers, and misinformation. However, the literature’s overwhelming reliance on Twitter makes it difficult to understand whether these phenomena generalize across other social media platforms. Here we present the first study to examine climate change discourse on Reddit, a popular–yet understudied–locus for climate debate. This contributes to the literature through expansion of the empirical base for the study of online communication about climate change beyond Twitter. Additionally, platform architecture of Reddit differs from many social media platforms in several ways which might impact the quality of the climate debate. We investigate this through topic modeling, community detection, and analysis of sources of information on a large corpus of Reddit data from 2017. Evidence of polarization is found through the topics discussed and sources of information shared. Yet, while some communities are dominated by particular ideological viewpoints, others are more suggestive of deliberative debate. We find little evidence for the presence of polarized echo chambers in the network structure on Reddit. These findings challenge our understanding of social media discourse around climate change and suggest that platform architecture plays a key role in shaping climate debate online."

The papers in this special issue discuss the importance of clear communication of scientific information, the dangers of misinformation and the possible role played by motivated reasoning, all themes that are taken up in the film. Ultimately, though, it is not enough to consider psychological factors in isolation: we must also acknowledge that cognitive flaws and psychological motivations are exploited by vested interests that profit from delaying climate action. A global response to a global crisis requires us to ‘look up’ to recognise the threat and to ‘look around’ to go beyond specialist disciplines and national boundaries."

Interactive documentaries convey information in many innovative formats, yet changing patterns of media consumption and the negative impact of misinformation can reduce their communicative effectiveness. Therefore, this article explores how we can identify different interactive structures and theoretical frameworks to help ensure I-Docs leverage the potential of emerging techniques to communicate climate change content effectively. This is increasingly important as climate change predictions become exponentially severe, and misinformation continues to distort the scientific consensus surrounding climate change during the Anthropocene. We investigate the thematic and structural properties of three interactive documentary works: “The Last Generation: Climate Change and the Marshall Islands”, “This is Climate Change: Melting Ice” and “Offshore”. Our results show how these divergent examples of I-Docs sit within current frameworks of Immersive Journalism and can use complex, non-linear narrative structures to explore environmental issues. We argue that the gamification of I-Doc work and the embedding of inoculation techniques offer the potential to engage audiences and reduce their susceptibility to climate change misinformation."

Many of the same individuals who deny the scientific consensus on climate change are nevertheless directly impacted by the climate crisis and environmental disasters. In fossil fuel dependent locations, do people continue to deny the scientific consensus on climate change and distrust climate scientists even after themselves experiencing a catastrophic flood? This paper investigates this question through interviews with 40 people affected by the 2013 Southern Alberta Flood, the costliest flood in Canadian history, who also live in the City of Calgary, the economic hub for Canada’s tar sands. Results indicate the participants rejected the scientific consensus on climate change, voiced a distrust in the motivations of climate scientists, though hoped they would one day discover the ‘truth’, and worked discursively to protect the oil industry. The findings reveal the complexity of post-disaster environmental views and trust in science, as well as how fossil fuel dependence shapes these views."

One notable effect was consistent across countries though stronger in Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD) nations: General faith in science was predicted by spirituality, suggesting that it, more than religiosity, may be the ‘enemy’ of science acceptance. Climate change skepticism was mainly associated with political conservatism especially in North America.

Facing these limitations requires us to consider the inherently violent and unsustainable nature of our modern-colonial modes of existence. Thus, we propose a shift from “education for sustainable development” to “education for the end of the world as we know it.” We contend that the predicament we face is not primarily rooted in ignorance and thus solvable with more knowledge, nor primarily rooted in immorality and thus solvable with more normative values; rather, it is rooted in denials that stem from harmful desires for and investments in the continuity of the securities and satisfactions promised by modernity-coloniality. Faced with these denials, we emphasize a collective need to “grow up” so that we might “show up” differently to do the work that is needed as we face unprecedented global challenges."

This article reports findings from surveys of climate change perceptions in six Chinese cities (∼40 million people). We identify 10 distinct mental images and 37 subcategories that represent a wide spectrum of perceptions of climate change among the Chinese public. The results reveal that people tend to conflate climate change with air pollution and seasonal weather changes. Although skepticism is not prominent, voices for action are also limited. Furthermore, climate change perceptions are heterogenous across regions and demographic groups. Respondents from developed cities are less likely to conflate climate change with local weather. People living in polluted regions tend to equate climate change with air pollution. Well-educated, high-income, and young residents are more aware of the scientific dimensions of climate change and its consequences. Females and the elderly think more about health implications and how to adapt. Compared to Western countries, opinions about climate change in China are less polarized and controversial, probably due to different political realities and media framings. This study provides an updated picture of climate change perceptions among the Chinese general public and recommends targeted and multi-level communication strategies for policymakers."

Political orientation is the strongest demographic correlate of climate change denial and climate refugee policy support, but deeper analysis shows that while support is highest amongst left-wing partisans, almost all voting groups on average accept climate change and climate migration policy.

Bots promote the saliency of energy, climate actions and climate strikes on public agenda. 83.1% of tweets posted by social bots support climate change activism, and 16.9% support climate change skepticism. However, social bot skeptics are more strategical than social bot activists in terms of launching conversations with opposing-minded humans, and avoiding amplification of opposing voices. They are also more successful in inciting opposing-minded humans' initiative conversation and like-minded humans' amplification. Based on the above findings, we suggest cultivating individuals’ media literacy in terms of distinguishing malicious social bots as a potential solution to deal with social bot skeptics disguised as humans, as well as making use of benign social bots for science popularization."

Interpretive (recognition of climate change as a problem but re-interpretation of its severity) and implicatory denial of climate change (recognition of climate change as a problem but denial of psychological, political, and moral implications) can be interpreted as self-protective strategies people use to protect the self in the face of threat. However, research has not integrated individual self-protective strategies into one comprehensive measure. The present research aimed at reviewing the existing literature and constructing the Climate Self-Protection Scale (CSPS) to make climate-relevant defensive self-protection measurable. In Study 1, N = 354 Germans responded to a pool of items. Using exploratory main axis analysis, we identified five factors, corresponding to the self-protective strategies rationalization of own involvement, avoidance, denial of personal outcome severity, denial of global outcome severity, and denial of guilt. Study 2 (N = 453 Germans) used confirmatory factor analysis to verify the five-factorial structure of the CSPS. Self-protective strategies were positively related with each other (except for avoidance and denial of guilt) and fit into a framework of interpretive (denial of global and personal outcome severity) and implicatory denial (rationalization, avoidance, denial of guilt). They related positively to male gender and right-wing political orientation, and negatively to various indicators of pro-environmentalism. This provides evidence of criterion and construct validity of the CSPS. In future research, the scale could be used as a tool to examine climate-relevant self-protective strategies further."

We aimed to identify the personality traits associated with climate change denial, environmental self-concept, and pro-environmental behaviours. We measured personality using the Big Five Aspect Scales. Using hierarchical multiple regressions, we determined the personality profile that predicts climate change denial, ecological self-concept, and pro-environmental behaviour. At the domain level, the Openness/Intellect domain significantly predicted each of the environmental constructs, and the Agreeableness domain was predictive of ecological self-concept and climate change acceptance. At the aspect level, the Openness aspect was the primary personality predictor for each construct. Our results demonstrate that aspect level analyses could be more efficacious than domain level analysis, as they have greater specificity and explanatory power."

It facilitates political procrastination and brings us ever closer to a world beset by growing food insecurity, heatwaves, floods, storms, fires and extensive losses to biodiversity. Numerous studies have unmasked the private agendas and corporate links behind organized denial, yet the question of how deniers find traction with democratic publics has received comparatively little attention. Empirical surveys demonstrate a connection between people who are susceptible to the contrarian voices of denial and those inclined towards right-wing authoritarianism. In this essay, I bring Adorno’s mid-20th-century studies of right-wing authoritarian tendencies in American democracy to bear upon climate science denial. Adorno directs us away from a sole focus on how deniers manufacture doubt so as to give the impression that the science is not settled. He examines the ways that agitators not only spread misinformation but also foster emotional connections with people who seem to want to be conned. I locate organized denial within a strain of cultural life that Adorno describes as unserious. In late 1940s America, Adorno discerned a new shape of political subjectivity, which has become highly resonant today: a formally free individual who takes pleasure in lies that sound like truth."

Despite the magnitude of the threat, surprisingly few climate-related discussions take place on social media. What factors drive online discussions about climate change? In this study, we examined the occurrence of Reddit discussions around three types of climate-related events: natural disasters (e.g., hurricanes, wildfires), political events (i.e., 2016 United States Presidential election), and policy events (i.e., United States’ withdrawal from Paris Climate Agreement, release of IPCC report). The objective was to understand how different types of events influence collective action as measured by discussions of climate change. Six large US cities were selected based on the occurrence of at least one locally-relevant natural disaster since 2014. Posts (N = 4.4 million) from subreddits of the selected cities were collected to obtain a six-month period before and after local natural disasters as well as climate-related political and policy events (which applied equally to all cities). Climate change discussions increased significantly for all three types of events, with the highest discussion during the 2016 elections. Further, discussions returned to baseline levels within 2 months following natural disasters and policy events but continued at elevated rates for up to 4 months following the 2016 elections. The findings suggest that collective discussions on climate change are driven more by political leaders’ controversial positions than life-threatening local natural disasters themselves. Implications for collective action are discussed."

We argue that sexism, representing an investment in gendered hierarchies, contributes to climate change denial and policy opposition. Using nationally representative surveys from 2016 to 2018, we show a consistent relationship between sexism and opposition to climate change beliefs and policies. These results are consistent across measures of both climate change beliefs and support for climate policy. We then show that sexism is correlated with climate denial and opposition to climate policy within a wide variety of subgroups of interest: for both Democrats and Republicans and for groups sorted by ideology, gender, education, and age. We then extend our analysis back in time, looking at data from 2012, finding similar effects prior to the 2016 election. The consistent findings point to the central role that system justifying beliefs about gender play in shaping attitudes about climate change in the USA."

Notably, previous research suggests that climate change threats can cause people to display ethnocentric reactions to preserve the ingroup’s interests. In this research, we investigate the relation between collective narcissism and attitudes towards climate science. We argue that national collective narcissism is negatively associated with the acceptance of climate science. We further hypothesized that this relation might be mediated by conspiracy beliefs about climate change, because narcissistic identifiers are prone to hold conspiracy beliefs. In a pilot study (N = 409), we found that national collective narcissism was significantly associated with climate change conspiracy beliefs. In Study 1 (N = 295), climate change conspiracy beliefs mediated the negative relation between national collective narcissism and acceptance of climate science. In Study 2 (N = 375), this mediation was replicated when controlling for other forms of climate skepticism. Lastly, general conspiracy mentality did not mediate this relation, which emphasizes the importance of considering the specificity of climate change conspiracy theories (rather than generic propensity to believe in conspiracy theories) in understanding distrust of climate science."

What can follow is disinformation and misinformation. Therefore, this contribution aims to discuss the different ways in which the concept of nature is (ab)used in relation to climate change, starting from the social construction of nature. To this end, the discussion focuses on the role of reductionism in the promotion of an anthropocentric idea of nature, in which different narratives of climate change are placed: on the one hand, the rhetoric of ‘save climate/nature’, in which climate/nature are understood as a resource to be saved; on the other hand, the negationist theories, which exploit a concept of nature built to question the evidence offered by science."

Reporting on climate change also reached unprecedented levels in the growingly influential far-right media ecosystem; from being a topic discussed hardly at all, it became a prominent issue. In this study, we use a toolkit from critical discourse analysis (CDA) to research how three Swedish far-right digital media sites reported on climate during the years 2018-2019. We show how the use of conspiracy theories, anti-establishment rhetoric, and nationalistic arguments created an antagonistic reaction to increased demands for action on climate change. By putting climate in ironic quotation marks, a discourse was created where it was taken for granted that climate change was a hoax."

Producing accessible visualizations for a general audience is challenging, especially when many are based on graphics designed for scientists, present complex and abstract concepts, and utilize suboptimal design choices. This study tests whether diagnostic visualization guidelines can be used to identify communication shortcomings for climate indicators and to specify effective design modifications. Design guidelines were used to diagnose problems in three hard-to-understand indicators, and to create three improved modifications per indicator. Using online surveys, the efficacy of the modifications was tested in a control versus treatment setup that measured the degree to which respondents understood, found accessible, liked, and trusted the graphics. Furthermore, we assessed whether respondents’ numeracy, climate attitudes, and political party affiliation affected the impact of design improvements. Results showed that simplifying modifications had a large positive effect on understanding, ease of understanding, and liking, but not trust. Better designs improved understanding similarly for people with different degrees of numerical capacity. Moreover, while climate skepticism was associated with less positive subjective responses and greater mistrust toward climate communication, design modification improved understanding equally for people across the climate attitude and ideological spectrum. These findings point to diagnostic design guidelines as a useful tool for creating more accessible, engaging climate graphics for the public."

As humans have destroyed much of their warm spring habitat, many manatees are forced to rely on power plant hot water effluent to survive during cold winter months. Visitors’ reactions to the MVC are every bit as incongruous as a massive greenhouse gas pollutant source enabling a wildlife reserve. Notwithstanding its inescapable presence, visitor reviews of the MVC nearly uniformly ignore the immense power plant. We offer this study of online reviews of the MVC to examine how and why everyday people's interactions are fundamental to making dominant practices of anthropogenic ecological destruction unremarkable and, therefore, unfixable. Specifically, we argue the collective blindness reflected in the findings of this study exemplifies a broader sociocultural tendency to articulate and reinforce spaces of ecological “invisibility.” In such spaces, our quotidian practices and discourses play a central role in enabling collective environmental inattention and environmental inaction, especially when we are confronted with places in which the constructed binary between human and “natural” realms spectacularly collapses."

In these disputes, the facet of emotions ranges from negative feelings such as shame, guilt and grief, to positive ones such as hope and compassion. In our paper, we put a focus on these feelings, drawing a conceptual map of emotions triggered by ecological crises. In doing so, our aim is to highlight the ambivalences of the intense emotionality of climate change and its societal effects. The great attention and the reflexivity accorded to ‘climate emotions’, however, should not obscure the view towards those emotional dynamics that are responsible for concealing and denying ecological problems. Based on ethnographic and other empirical studies from social sciences we outline that it is precisely these little-illuminated aspects of emotional re-framing and public emotional silence, which often turn out to be particularly consequential moments in politics. Hence, the emotional motives behind the scene should not go unnoticed in sociological research on emotions within the ecological crises."

Asian Journal of Social Psychology published by Asian Association of Social Psychology and John Wiley & Sons Australia, LtdDespite the importance of overcoming the persistent delay in climate action, almost no research has investigated the psychological underpinnings of climate change denial in Asian countries. Addressing this research gap, our study compares results obtained in Hong Kong with those of samples from New Zealand and Sweden regarding correlations of climate change denial with acceptance of dominance between social groups (Social Dominance Orientation), acceptance of two additional forms of group-based dominance (humans over nature, and humans over animals), and empathic concern. Results showed that only acceptance of human dominance over nature and animals predicted climate change denial in Hong Kong. In New Zealand and Sweden, however, the results resembled those found in previous research: The strongest predictor was Social Dominance Orientation, followed by acceptance of human dominance over nature. Low empathic concern predicted climate change denial only in Sweden. Results in Hong Kong differ from previous findings and indicate that climate change denial in this East Asian society is motivated more by hierarchical attitudes related to nature than social groups. We discuss possible reasons for these distinct findings and conclude that there is a need for cross-cultural research to further investigate the psychological and culture-specific motivations to dismiss climate change."

We present an algorithmic corpus comparison and machine-learning topic model of 180 ExxonMobil climate change communications, including peer-reviewed publications, internal company documents, and advertorials in The New York Times. We also investigate advertorials using inductive frame analysis. We find that the company has publicly overemphasized some terms and topics while avoiding others. Most notably, they have used rhetoric of climate “risk” and consumer energy “demand” to construct a “Fossil Fuel Savior” (FFS) frame that downplays the reality and seriousness of climate change, normalizes fossil fuel lock-in, and individualizes responsibility. These patterns mimic the tobacco industry's documented strategy of shifting responsibility away from corporations—which knowingly sold a deadly product while denying its harms—and onto consumers. This historical parallel foreshadows the fossil fuel industry's use of demand-as-blame arguments to oppose litigation, regulation, and activism."
194,2-s2.0-85103752797,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdEmotions about climate change are the subject of a growing area of interdisciplinary scholarship. But so far scholars have not studied the emotions expressed by self-declared climate change skeptics; nor have social scientists turned to affect studies to develop nuanced understandings of the constellation of emotions related to fear. Our team conducted 33 interviews and 1000 surveys with self-identified skeptics living in the U.S. Pacific Northwest. The data demonstrates the variability in perspectives, ideologies, and behaviors among skeptics themselves in new and unique ways, including tracking skeptics’ emotions about climate change. This article focuses on worry and dread. We find that those who believe climate change is a hoax, and skeptics who are politically conservative, tend to express less of these two emotions, as do men who identify as skeptics. Religiosity, as measured by frequency of religious attendance, does not significantly correlate with worry and dread; however, specific religious beliefs related to climate change (e.g. “Climate change is punishment for our sins”) do seem to increase those two feelings. Negative firsthand environmental experiences are also associated with higher degrees of worry and dread. Perhaps most significantly, our data suggests that worry and dread correlate strongly with environmental concern and policy support. Our interdisciplinary approach has several methodological advantages. First, affect studies encourages more nuance in emotion language, including more detailed definitions of emotions like worry and dread, which simmer over time, as opposed to discrete emotions like fear, which are shorter-lived. Second, sociological approaches remind us that emotions function within particular political, historical, and cultural contexts, which are fundamentally shaped by power structures. Finally, humanities scholars can provide useful input both in research design and the interpretation of results by helping craft survey questions and data codes, and by providing close attention to the language of the survey and interview responses. Combined with quantitative data, this multi-pronged methodology brings together forms of knowledge from the humanities and social sciences. Our approach serves as a model for new work in the growing field of empirical ecocriticism and expands the boundaries of the environmental humanities."

We conceptualize skeptic/skepticism as an umbrella term that includes those who actively reject climate science and those who are uncertain about climate change. We propose four categories for better empirical analysis of climate skepticism: epistemic deniers, epistemic doubters (borrowing from Capstick and Pidgeon 2014), attribution deniers, and attribution doubters (borrowing from Rahmstorf 2004). Using a unique dataset of surveys (n = 1000) and interviews (n = 33) with residents of the U.S. Pacific Northwest who are skeptical about climate change, we compare those four groups across several predictors and demographic variables (age, race, gender, political ideology, religiosity, income, education, and level of trust in science) and outcome variables (environmental concern, policy support, and conspiracy ideation (adherence to the belief that climate change is a “hoax”). We demonstrate the importance of considering attitudinal uncertainty in the analysis of climate skepticism by providing evidence for the presence of a continuum of thought wherein epistemic deniers and attribution doubters make up the two ends of a continuum with more complicated distinctions between epistemic doubters and attribution deniers."

It nevertheless has its critics, consisting of people denying climate change or minimizing the responsibility of human beings in the process. This skepticism partly derives from the complexity of the topic, encouraging people to rely on cognitive shortcuts to grasp the phenomenon. We question the role of analytic cognitive style, general and climate change-related knowledge, overconfidence, and political partisanship (plus additional expected confounding variables) in this process through a package of three studies (total N = 1031). In a first study, we showed that an intuitive mindset predicted greater skepticism relative to an analytical mindset while controlling for cognitive ability and the degree to which individuals value science, suggesting that reasoning cognitive style and trust are key parameters of climate change skepticism. A second study highlighted that climate science knowledge stands as strong and independent predictors of skepticism relative to analytic cognitive style. A final study revealed that analytic cognitive style and climate change knowledge generated less influence on climate change skepticism among conservatives than among liberals and moderates, suggesting that reliance on deliberative thinking and knowledgeability on climate science are not sufficient to mitigate climate change skepticism among conservatives. We discuss the critical interplay between cognitive processes and political partisanship in this ongoing debate."

Building upon the literature of ecoanxiety and the palliative function of ideological beliefs, we assumed that the acknowledgment of climate change intensifies ecoanxiety while climate change denial eases it. More importantly, we also assumed that the extent of this ease is larger in countries being more threatened by the harmful consequences of climate change. To test this assumption, we analyzed data collected from representative samples of 23 European countries within European Social Survey Programme, and additional data on the actual exposure of these countries to the effects of climate change. Results of our multilevel models showed that climate change denial is related to lower ecoanxiety, and this negative relationship is stronger at high (vs. low) levels of climate change exposure. Our results support the general principle stating that the harsher reality is the larger emotional benefit can be achieved by its distorted perception and denial. This psychological defense mechanism can partly explain why many people are reluctant to fight against climate change even in countries that are threatened by it."

While their position of political influence in the Republican coalition is widely recognised, the full range of effects of this position on evangelicals' climate opinions is not. To move research on evangelicals from the margins of climate change opinion research, we review and integrate the interdisciplinary literature on US evangelicals, climate change, and politics. In assessing this literature, we identify three areas in need of further research. First, there is a critical need for more research on the climate attitudes of evangelicals of color, who comprise a growing share of the evangelical tradition in the US. Second, highlighting the Christian Right's active engagement in the climate debate, we identify a need for more experimental work examining how cues from religious elites may shape evangelicals' opinions. Finally, we suggest that to better harness insights across disciplines, researchers must become more explicitly aware of how different disciplines conceptualize temporality. Attending to temporal scale suggests that a new approach is needed to test how dominion beliefs, which are widely thought to be an important theological driver of climate skepticism, operate. We also suggest that two factors that appear to play a weak or limited role in driving climate skepticism over the short term (anti-science attitudes and evangelical religiosity) may in fact play a significant role in driving skepticism over the medium term.

Recent research highlighting the role of ideologies and worldviews in shaping science skepticism can inform research questions as well as pandemic responses to COVID-19. It is likely that the antecedents of general COVID-19-related skepticism substantially overlap with the antecedents of climate change skepticism. Additionally, skepticism about a potential vaccine in particular will likely be fueled by similar worries and misperceptions to those shaping more general antivaccination attitudes, of which conspiracy thinking is particularly worth highlighting.

By looking at the recent and historic changes in the configuration of his identity, I argue that Schwarzenegger is tracking and re-embodying himself along with the changing discourses on gender and environmental justice that gravitate towards the values and practises elsewhere described as “ecological masculinities” (Hultman, 2017; Hultman & Pulé, 2018)."

Yet, what constitutes climate denial has evolved considerably from its original ascription for those who deny the physical science of anthropogenic global warming. This paper unpacks the multiple contemporary meanings of climate denial to examine whether this moniker can correlate with rational action (i.e. principled action logically derived from reliable knowledge), and how rationality can be deployed when pursuing political priorities that conflict with the orthodox normative positions of experts. Valid modes of rationality are diverse and not the sole preserve of those proponents of transformative and/or unified climate change action. Modes of rationality are also intimately linked to problem framing. Experts' existing problem-frames may actually facilitate Deniers' avoidance of the sorts of rationalisations that experts wish them to make. By better understanding the rationalities pertaining to the climate change debate, the paper concludes, experts and advocates can tailor their communication to more effectively influence the design of effective policies. A better understanding of how Climate Deniers can be rational and how rationalisation relates to problem framing may be necessary to address the most polarised politics of the climate crisis."

We examine the period around the time of U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement of U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on June 1, 2017. We find that the announcement generated an immediate online social movement response with very low suspected bot presence. Prior to and afterwards, however, suspected bots were responsible for approximately 25% of original tweets. Additionally, we find that suspected bots were more frequent in some topic areas than others, including denialist discourses focused on research questioning the reality or importance of climate change. Key policy insights On an average day during our study period, automated bots produced an estimated one-quarter of all original tweets referencing climate change and global warming. Bots were more active in some discussion areas than others - including climate denialist messages. President Trump's announcement of the U.S.'s planned withdrawal from the Paris Agreement generated an immediate online social movement response with very low suspected bot presence. For social media to deliver on its promise of a decentralized and democratic forum, automated accounts need to be identified, marginalized, and removed."

A newly discovered archival document shows the American Petroleum Institute was promulgating false and misleading information about climate change in 1980, nearly a decade earlier than previously known, in order to promote public policies favorable to the fossil fuel industry. This finding demonstrates early use of public-facing disinformation about global warming by the petroleum industry and suggests commercial fossil fuel interests played a more obstructive role in climate change discourse and policy throughout the 1980s than previously understood."

In doing so, we begin to fill an important ‘conspiracy gap’ in extant literature on climate skepticism. Results reveal that, among climate change skeptics, conspiracy adherents are more likely to be male, politically conservative, older, more religious, more educated, and have higher levels of income compared to non-conspiracists. Furthermore, conspiracy adherents and non-conspiracists vary in important ways in their levels of institutional trust, information sources, pro-environmental beliefs, and emotion-based responses to climate change. Recognizing these important differences among groups that constitute U.S. climate skeptics could potentially open up new avenues for climate change communication and policy."

This paper draws on qualitative interviews with 33 agricultural producers who discussed climate change during a larger project on adaptation to climate extremes. We inductively analyzed climate change beliefs and perceptions into five themes. Common themes included uncertainty and attribution skepticism (i.e., attribution of climate change to natural cycles only). Past experience and personal observation strongly shaped climate beliefs, but in diverse ways. We examine links between producers’ climate change views and their adaptive and mitigative practices. Climate change belief did not appear to influence farmers’ environmental practices, which are motivated by economic and environmental factors. Although past experience encourages adaptation, beliefs about natural climate cycles—and the limitations of even intergenerational memory of past extremes—may ultimately reduce preparedness for the unexpected “extreme extremes” of the future."

Prior research finds political-economic factors shape climate change views, perceptions of and policy support for renewable and nonrenewable energy, and pro-environmental behaviors (PEBs). This study contributes to research in these three areas by empirically testing the anti-reflexivity thesis, which posits that forces defending the industrial capitalist system are sources of anti-reflexivity, obstructing critical self-evaluation and societal action to address climate change. Using OLS and logistic regression analysis of survey data from respondents in five states in the US Intermountain West region, we find empirical support for the effect of anti-reflexivity on climate views, energy policy support, and PEBs. We also find that PEBs in the Intermountain West still largely occur in the realm of personal conservation actions rather than being politically focused, collectively organized, or leading toward systemic change."

However, previous research has almost exclusively focused on the mainstream right, which differs from the far right (radical and extreme) in some important domains. Thus, we investigated correlates of climate change denial among supporters of a radical right-wing party (Sweden Democrats, N = 2216), a mainstream right-wing party (the Conservative Party, Moderaterna, N = 634), and a mainstream center-left party (Social Democrats, N = 548) in Sweden. Across the analyses, distrust of public service media (Swedish Television, SVT), socioeconomic right-wing attitudes, and antifeminist attitudes outperformed the effects of anti-immigration attitudes and political distrust in explaining climate change denial, perhaps because of a lesser distinguishing capability of the latter mentioned variables. For example, virtually all Sweden Democrat supporters oppose immigration. Furthermore, the effects of party support, conservative ideologies, and belief in conspiracies were relatively weak, and vanished or substantially weakened in the full models. Our results suggest that socioeconomic attitudes (characteristic for the mainstream right) and exclusionary sociocultural attitudes and institutional distrust (characteristic for the contemporary European radical right) are important predictors of climate change denial, and more important than party support per se."

In this paper, we identify five scripture-based arguments against greenhouse gas mitigation put forward by a core group of Christian conservatives (‘the Cornwallists’): the anti-paganism argument, the enrichment argument, the omnipotence argument, the lack of moral relevance argument and the cost-benefit argument. We evaluate to what extent the arguments express positions that can be characterised as climate science denialist and to what degree they are consistent with support for climate adaptation. Using Stefan Rahmstorf’s (2004) taxonomy of climate science denial, we conclude that the Cornwallists could be labelled climate change deniers. However, their opposition is not only based on denial of climate science but often rests on premises that render the science irrelevant, a position we term ‘relevance denialism’."

In this paper, we argue that current free speech jurisprudence in the US inadequately addresses the risk of climate change because it is overly permissive of ‘pro-fessional’ climate denial and underappreciates the need to address the future harm of climate change today. We begin by clarifying the risk posed by the Supreme Court’s current approach to speech with respect to climate change and, relatedly, reviewing the philosophical foundations of the marketplace of ideas found in the work of John Stuart Mill. Following this, we examine three potential ways in which Supreme Court jurisprudence could be used to limit what we term ‘professional climate change denial’ while permitting a degree of ‘private’ scepticism. Largely setting aside the return to earlier free speech jurisprudence and the extension of libel law, we offer a novel solution to the problem that suggests that ‘professional’ climate denial could be treated as a categorical exception under free speech jurisprudence and thus afforded a lower level of constitutional protection than other expression."

These beliefs and their associated behaviors, including climate destructiveness, can be conceptualized as compensatory reactions to modern-day racial, gender, and climate-related anxieties that are experienced as threats to traditional white male privilege and power. They then manifest as and energize authoritarian desires and their associated sociopolitical movements, including the current Republican effort to Make American Great Again. This paper utilizes psychoanalytic concepts concerning individual and large-group identity, group psychodynamics and processes, and the intergenerational transmission of idealized myth and fantasy to further elucidate and expand upon these complex phenomena. It then suggests specific strategies for disentangling the strong links between white hegemonic masculinity, fossil fuel use, and climate change denial, thus opening doors to alternative, non climate-destructive yet still empowering notions of individual, large-group, and national identity that are, instead, based in communal concern and climate care."

Comparatively in Europe (EU), research has been lacking. This investigation therefore attends to that gap. We conducted a frame analysis on eight most prominent contrarian think tanks in six countries and four languages in Europe over 24 years (1994–2018). We found that there has been consistent contrarian framing through think tanks in the EU regarding climate change. Yet, we found a proliferation of contrarian outputs particularly in recent years. This uptick in quantity correlates with increases in CCM activities in the US. Our content analyses showed that well-worn climate change counter-frames spread by US CCM organizations were consistently circulated by European organizations as well. Moreover, we found that, as in the US, neoliberal ideological stances stood out as the most frequently taken up by contrarian think tanks in Europe. As such, we documented that CCM tropes and activities have flowed strongly between US and EU countries."

This study uses an experimental design on a national sample to test two features of user-based correction strategies on Instagram for a divisive issue on which misinformation abounds: the issue of climate change. First, we unite the inoculation and correction literature to test the efficacy of prebunking corrections that come before exposure to the misinformation versus debunking strategies that occur after exposure. Second, we compare fact-focused corrections that provide accurate information to rebut the misinformation against logic-focused corrections that highlight the rhetorical flaw underpinning the misinformation. Our findings suggest that these strategies intersect to reduce misperceptions. Logic-focused corrections effectively reduce misperceptions regardless of their placement before or after the misinformation, and appear to function in part by reducing perceptions of the credibility of the misinformation post. Fact-focused corrections only reduce misperceptions when they occur after the misinformation, but are seen as more credible than logic-focused corrections. We discuss the implications of our findings for understanding the theoretical mechanism by which correction can occur and the practical guidelines to best correct misinformation in visual social media spaces."

We focused here on the role of the papers included by the report editors concerning the mainstream claims around climate change. Our results showed moderate differences in the endorsement rates as well as in the sources of contrarian arguments considering the contrarian report in general and the presented journals specifically. These outcomes indicate differences among the journals regarding editorial practice, topic-dependency, and the home field advantage of some authors. Beyond the bibliometric data, our additional rhetorical analysis showed that language and wording are at least as important as the references backing the claims. The well-founded atmosphere of doubt in the climate skeptic report relies on two prevalent factors working together: relevant information accumulated on methodological uncertainties and findings that do not support mainstream knowledge claims (1); and solemn rhetoric supplemented with proper re-contextualization and reinterpretation (2)."

The moderating effect of climate change skepticism is also considered in this study. A total of 745 nationwide and self-reported questionnaire valid data was collected in Taiwan. Hierarchical and moderated regression analysis results indicated that the components of the TPB model had positive influences on the public's purchase intention. The public's perceived moral obligation and sustainability self-identity, proposed for inclusion in the TPB model, had significant and positive influences on purchase intention. The extended TPB model has higher explanatory power than that of the original model. The positive relationship between sustainability self-identity and intention to purchase sustainability-labeled coffee was moderated by climate change skepticism. This study provides marketers and the players in the supply chain with a comprehensive framework for understanding the influence of perceived moral obligation and sustainability self-identity on purchase intention toward sustainability-labeled products. In addition, this study responds to a call for a more thorough investigation of the effect of people's skepticism about climate change in the context of ethical and sustainable consumption decision-making processes."

Previous studies have found that resistance to misinformation can be induced by cognitively inoculating individuals against doubt-sowing about climate change. However, the long-term effectiveness of this approach is currently unknown. In a preregistered replication and extension experiment we combined a scientific consensus message with an inoculation treatment, and exposed participants to an influential misinformation message one week later. We explored 1) whether we can replicate the finding that inoculation is able to protect against a misinformation attack, and 2) whether or not the consensus and inoculation effects remain stable over the course of one week. Successfully replicating the effects of the original study, we found a strong initial consensus effect that is sensitive to doubt-sowing misinformation. Importantly, we also found that the consensus effect can be inoculated against misinformation. Extending the replication, we found that the consensus effect shows partial decay over time, while the inoculation effect remains stable for at least one week. We discuss the impact of our findings for inoculation theory, climate change psychology, and public policy."

Members of the public are nevertheless frequently exposed to misinformation about climate change (and the degree of scientific consensus on climate change). One strategy to combat such misinformation is attitudinal “inoculation”—exposing individuals to a weakened item of misinformation along with a pre-emptive refutation. Van der Linden, Leiserowitz, Rosenthal, and Maibach (2017) reported that exposing participants to misinformation reduced the extent to which the participants perceived there to be a scientific consensus about climate change, but that the effect of this misinformation was successfully countered by an attitudinal inoculation. In this study, we report a preregistered replication of van der Linden et al. (2017). Our replication study used a mixed between-within design, with data collected via Mechanical Turk (N = 792). We were able to replicate some (but not all) of van der Linden et al.’s findings. Specifically, we found that providing information about the scientific consensus on climate change increased perceptions of scientific consensus, as did an inoculation provided prior to provision of misinformation. However, we were unable to replicate their finding that an inoculation counteracted the effect of misinformation to a greater extent than simply providing information about scientific consensus—although this may have been due to a ceiling effect in our study.

Additionally, optimizing messaging for communicating CC and encouraging greater mitigation behavior can yield significant benefits to global stakeholders. Here we evaluated the effectiveness of informative, persuasive and empathic message frames about a major climate-related local flooding event through online surveys administered to 370 adults in Manitoba and Saskatchewan, Canada and 360 adults in Queensland, Australia. Measures of trust in climate communicators and climate science, concern over CC effects, and belief that most recent floods are due to CC were assessed before and after message exposure, along with related values, beliefs and emotions. Willingness to support pro-environmental groups was assessed as a proxy measure of behavioural intent. Cumulative odds ordinal regression and multinomial regression were used to predict group membership (no support, passive support, active support). Political affiliation, trust and belief in CC, belief in anthropogenic CC, pro-environmental values, and, in some regressions, previous flood exposure, were significant predictors of activism support. Respondents who received the empathic message frame and had low to medium pro-environmental values were more likely to believe the link between flooding and CC compared to those who received the informative message frame. These results, including the finding that some elicited emotions predicted behavioral intent, provide insight into how to construct climate information for groups with varying beliefs, values and experiences, to reduce climate skepticism and encourage pro-environmental behavior."

Recent recessions in the Norwegian oil industry caused an influx of dismissed oil engineers into Norwegian science teacher education. With their background in the natural sciences and associations with the oil industry, this group of pre-service teachers might express mixed attitudes towards HICC and how to approach this subject while teaching. A survey of students attending a one-year course for qualifying people with a university degree in science as science teachers was conducted. Association with the oil industry covaries with climate skeptic thinking and reluctance towards teaching about HICC in these groups of students.

These political implications have created an environment of rhetorical adversity in which disinformation abounds, thus compounding the challenges for climate communicators. The existing literature on how to communicate climate change and dispel misinformation converges on several conclusions: First, providing information about climate change, in particular explanations of why it occurs, can enhance people's acceptance of science. Second, highlighting the scientific consensus can be an effective means to counter misinformation and raise public acceptance. Third, culturally aligned messages and messengers are more likely to be successful. Finally, climate misinformation is best defanged, through a process known as inoculation, before it is encountered, although debunking techniques can also be successful."

Each involves a rejection of scientific method. This rejection inherently lends itself to far-right politics, which is a philosophy of prejudice. The pre-valence of such a philosophy in contemporary American political culture, exemplified through climate change denial, has arguably opened the door for a president of Trump’s type. Nevertheless, the US Constitution is far more difficult to suspend than that of the Weimar Republic. As a result, US institutional safeguards against a philosophy of prejudice are likely to hold against a short-term assault on environmental justice in a way that the Weimar Republic’s constitutional order did not against Nazism’s assault on civil rights. The greater threat to environmental protection in the contemporary US situation is the slow erosion of democratic norms by the Trump administration."

Our previous research has shown that citizens regard such behavioral shifts as extremely daunting and create a number of psychological denial mechanisms that draw attention to the inaction of others, including governments. Further theoretical insights and relevant new findings have been attained from a more recent survey of more than 1000 German residents. This reveals that direct denial of anthropogenic climate change is replaced by a denial of responsibility for individual climate action. Ways of moral disengagement play a more dominant role, such as the diffusion and displacement of responsibility, although a majority is aware of-and very much concerned about-the climate crisis. More attention needs to be given for further reinterpretation of the role of moral disengagement to single out adequate strategies for different individuals and groups of people, such as making role models more visible to encourage social learning that could accelerate further necessary moral and behavioral transformations."

Methods: Based on a selective literature review regarding the works of Clayton et al. (2015), Marshall (2015), Orange (2018) and Hoggett (2019) as well as conflict and (socio)structural considerations derived from operationalized psychodynamic diagnostics (OPD), different pillars of an integrative “value-action gap” model, reflecting the discrepancy between knowledge and taking action, were developed. Results: In a narrative review, considerations from cognitive psychology, psychodynamics, and psychotraumatology on how to deal with global warming are presented. Concepts of “cognitive distortion”, “denial” and “omnipotence”, of the individual and social “lack of structure” and the “traumatization of victims and perpetrators” are the key points of this work. Conclusion: Cognitive psychological, psychodynamic and psychotraumatological concepts allow us to gain a deeper understanding of our apparent inability to act on global warming and, in a best case scenario, may help us to overcome this incapacity. Potential implications for psychotherapists and psychotherapy are explored."

Here, a structural account of this phenomenon is advanced, which suggests that environmental policies are generally outcompeted among government priorities wherever they threaten the capitalist growth imperative. In addition, social/cultural factors, based on the psychology of denial, provide a necessary contribution to our understanding. A three-fold denialism is at work: of climate change itself, the measures required to tackle it (where these contradict a modern faith in material progress), and the potential incapacity of the state to protect society (discouraging close attention to the effectiveness of its climate policies)."

This chapter explores the political economy of global air pollution including an analysis of international trade that perpetuates and exacerbates emissions and the environmental injustices associated with global warming and air quality ill health.

Consumers can take responsibility to society and the environment by purchasing products that are least harmful to humans and nature. By doing so, the opportunities of life and consumption of other people and future generations are affected as little as possible. Previous studies indicated that the inclusion of perceived moral obligations in the theory of planned behavior (TPB) model has greatly improved the prediction of individual’s behavioral intention. Self-identity was also found as a significant predictor of pro-environmental behaviors. But an individual’s skepticism and uncertainty of climate change may reduce his or her willingness to act pro-environmental behaviors. In view of the growing coffee consumption market in Taiwan and the environmental impact of coffee production, this study aims to explore Taiwanese public’s attitude toward purchasing sustainability labeled coffee and their purchase intentions. People’s perceived moral obligation and pro-environmental self-identity are included in the TPB model to increase the model’s explanatory power. The moderating effect of people’s skeptical attitude toward climate change is also considered in this study. A nationwide and self-reported questionnaire was distributed in Taiwan. The collected data was analyzed by moderated regression analysis. The research results revealed that as expected the original three components in the TPB model (i.e., attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control) have influences on people’s purchase intentions of sustainability labeled coffee, the additional two factors (i.e., perceived moral obligations and pro-environmental self-identity) also have influences on people’s purchase intentions of sustainability labeled coffee. Moreover, the moderating effect of climate change skepticism on the positive relationship between pro-environmental self-identity and purchase intentions of sustainable labeled coffee was verified.

Accordingly, the animal-based food taboo is defined here as our reluctance not only to change but to even discuss changing our food habits, a strong evidence that moral anthropocentrism is not addressed as a problem, which amounts to a type of denial. Through a literature review conducted on the most relevant comparative studies of deontological codes, this paper shows that codes of journalism do not escape moral anthropocentrism, and thus contribute to prevent journalists from stressing the relevant role diet plays in our ethics and sustainability efforts. The paper ends by suggesting ways to expand and update media ethics and deontological codes in journalism to dismantle both the taboo and the moral anthropocentric stance it is based on."

The present experiment's results indicate that people are reliant on numerical information in their determination of whether a statistic related to global warming is representative or misleading. Of particularly practical significance, the results also demonstrate that showing participants a mixed set of revealing and misleading global warming statistics leads to an increase in global warming acceptance, rather than sowing confusion (or some sense that all data are equally dubious or compelling). Replicating prior results, nationalism and global warming acceptance are in a negative relationship. We also describe the background, design, and assessment of a curriculum intended to help the general public better distinguish between representative and misleading statistics about anthropogenic climate change. The findings highlight numerically-driven inferencing as a useful paradigm for the assessment of information relating to global warming and environmental risk."

This hoax discourse identifies one side as deniers of scientific facts and the other side as manufacturing false alarm. We study the hoax discourse on climate change in the English-speaking blogosphere as a disruptive discursive practice. The study uses automated, qualitative, and quantitative content analysis as well as network analysis to identify the main patterns of the hoax discourse, drawing on a sample of almost 50,000 blog posts related to climate change published online for one year, from May 14, 2016, to May 14, 2017. The study shows that hoax discourses are a salient feature of online debates. They engage both mainstream voices and contrarians in mutual accusations. Accusations of untruthfulness are rarely voiced in a way that identifies concrete lies and liars; instead, they form part of broad attacks designed to vilify the other group. The discourse does not directly address the other side of the debate. It does not constitute a deliberation, but rather serves to affirm one’s social group identity and exacerbate mutual group polarization."

There is also a growing tendency for Pacific governments to use unconstitutional, bureaucratic or legal tools to silence media and questioning journalists. Frequent threats of closing Facebook and other social media platforms and curbs on online freedom of information are another issue. While Pacific news media face these challenges, their support networks are being shaken by the decline of Australia as a so-called ‘liberal democracy’ and through the undermining of its traditional region-wide public interest media values with the axing of Radio Australia and Australia Network television. Reporting climate change is the Pacific’s most critical challenge while Australian intransigence over the issue is subverting the region’s media. This article engages with and examines these challenges and also concludes that the case of West Papua is a vitally important selfdetermination issue that left unresolved threatens the security of the region."

Skeptics tend to question the reality and human causes of climate change by (1) raising concerns about incentive structures in science that could bias climatology, (2) doubting the accuracy of data and models used by climate scientists, and (3) perceiving some practices of climate science and scientists as exclusionary. Despite these concerns, skeptics exhibit deference to scientific authority when using scientific assessments to make policy decisions, including environmental policy. Understanding skeptics’ concerns about climate science and areas where they support science-based policy, will lead to better dialogue between scientists, interest groups, policy makers, and the skeptical public, potentially clarifying avenues to communicate climate information and enact climate policy."
253,2-s2.0-85073808721,"© 2019 Eastern Sociological SocietyThe political rise of right-wing populism in the United States, and elsewhere, has prompted a reexamination of theoretical perspectives that oscillate on an unequivocal rejection of objective reality. Indeed, populist campaigns that have acquired wide currency in the last few years have been ontologically predicated on the idea that there exists different “truths.” The premise of different truths has debunked any notion of an objective reality by rendering even the most reified of “facts” to be the outcome of individual subjectivities and ideological subscriptions. Donald Trump’s appeal to “fake news,” for instance, captures the implications that emerge when certain material “facts” become delegitimated in the public arena. The obfuscation of material facts through its entanglements in political discourse raises a timely question concerning theoretical resistance: How can objective reality retain its conceptual and analytical ideations without succumbing to the dangers that objective science historically created for socially marginalized subjects? Contextualizing the denial of anthropogenic climate change as an illustrative case, I answer this question by developing theoretical insights from critical realism and the notion of feminist objectivity. These insights accept the socially constructed nature of an objective reality but refute the idea of value-free knowledge—that is, it disavows the claim that all representations of knowledge are equally valid and equally valuable."

To do so, we combine link tracing and quantitative content analysis in the field of climate change in Germany and the United Kingdom. Our results show that online contestation is indeed structured by competing coalitions of climate advocates and skeptics. Moreover, the counter-coalitions of climate skeptics turn out to be the true winners of online communication: they have not only incorporated conservative media as their allies, but also managed to make themselves more visible than climate advocates. This visibility stems from their own link setting activity, which makes climate advocates’ passive online strategy of just ignoring the skeptical camp ineffective."

However, in many societies there is substantial evidence of biased cognition and polarisation about climate change. Further, many appear unable to distinguish reliable scientific information from false claims or misinformation. While deliberation significantly reduces polarisation about climate change, and can even increase the provision of reliable beliefs, these benefits are difficult to scale up, and are slow to affect whole societies. In response, I propose a combined strategy of 'thinking and nudging'. While deliberative theorists tend to view nudging askance, combining deliberation with nudges promises to be a timelier and more effective response to climate change than deliberation alone. I outline several proposals to improve societal deliberative capacity while reducing climate risks, including media reform, strategic communication and framing of debates, incentivising pro-climate behaviour change, and better education about science."

This study tested the effect of two simple interventions, both of which primed critical thinking, on individuals’ evaluation of the credibility of real and fake news about climate change on Facebook. Through an online experiment (n = 2,750 participants), participants either read a series of guidelines for evaluating news online, or read and then rated the importance of each guideline; a control group was not exposed to guidelines of any type. We found that participants exposed to both types of guidelines reported a reduced likelihood to trust, like, and share fake news about climate change on Facebook. Importantly, exposure to these guidelines did not diminish individuals’ likelihood to trust, like, or share legitimate climate news. The effect sizes for both types of intervention were small. However, because of the scale and speed at which social media operates, even a small reduction in users’ likelihood to trust, like, and share fake news could be meaningful and impactful."

While these environmental and political crises have been analyzed on their own, little research has been done on their nexus. Against this background, this focus article reviews existing academic literature on far-right climate-change communication by European party and nonparty actors, that is, climate-change communication from a distinctively ethno-nationalist and authoritarian perspective. The far right is not a homogenous entity but best viewed as a continuum, ranging from radical-right, anti-liberal democracy actors to extreme-right, anti-democracy ones. This contribution to WIREs Climate Change argues that many, though not all, far-right party and nonparty actors are skeptical towards (anthropogenic) climate change and/or responses to it, at least in comparison to the European mainstream.

While debates continue over how to mitigate emissions, it is evident that many parts of the world will need to adapt to an increasingly unstable climate. However, the persistence of climate denial presents a significant barrier to climate change response; if a future in which the climate has dramatically changed cannot be imagined, there is little motivation to act. Using qualitative interview data, our research investigates community responses to climate change adaptation planning in a coastal region of Australia identified as highly vulnerable to future sea level rise. While the local council engaged in extensive consultation to develop an adaptation plan, community opposition to proposed development changes ultimately resulted in a ‘wait and see’ response. We show how the community's local understandings of place informed temporalities that led to a practice of climate denial. We outline three processes by which climate denial is socially organised: anchoring the past via historical reference; projecting continuity through a nostalgic lens of managing disaster; and enclosing the present by prioritising existing economic value. We show how these processes result in the social organisation of climate denial, and an inability to plan for a climate changed future."

For example, the tobacco industry denied the medical consensus on the harms of smoking for decades, and the clear evidence about human-caused climate change is currently being rejected by many politicians and think tanks that oppose regulatory action. We present an agent-based model of the processes by which denial of climate change can occur, how opinions that run counter to the evidence can affect the scientific community, and how denial can alter the public discourse. The model involves an ensemble of Bayesian agents, representing the scientific community, that are presented with the emerging historical evidence of climate change and that also communicate the evidence to each other. Over time, the scientific community comes to agreement that the climate is changing. When a minority of agents is introduced that is resistant to the evidence, but that enter into the scientific discussion, the simulated scientific community still acquires firm knowledge but consensus formation is delayed. When both types of agents are communicating with the general public, the public remains ambivalent about the reality of climate change. The model captures essential aspects of the actual evolution of scientific and public opinion during the last 4 decades."
265,2-s2.0-85068039844,"© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Psychological reactions to climate change run the gamut from a sense of the need for urgent action to utter denial. This paper looks at some categories of defenses that block acknowledgement of this pressing threat. It cites the work of Renee Lertzman, an analytically oriented social scientist, whose research suggested that disavowal, negation, or denial could be deconstructed and viewed as defenses against intolerable anxieties, feelings of helplessness and disappointment, loss and guilt, and warded-off wishes for agency and reparation. Clinical examples and personal self-reflection are employed to posit that when anxiety over climate change, a serious disquiet in its own right, gets confused with childhood traumatic anxiety, with its attendant feelings of helplessness, smallness, hopelessness, shame, isolation, and useless rage, then dysfunctional defenses and affects are more likely to come to the fore. In contrast to this, realistic anxiety over our changing climate and need to shift from a carbon-based culture can be made more tolerable and can allow one to face the uncertain future, to feel one's feelings, to work them through, to share them without shame, and to feel a certain amount of agency in confronting the climate future and working to cope with it, both individually and societally. Finally, the paper suggests that we clinicians need to listen with new awareness to patients' references to and defenses against climate change, as not simply displacements but also as allusions to a looming reality that is a thing in itself. It is suggested that although we cannot impose our agendas on our patients, as climate change disavowal breaks down, we do have in our tool kit ways of helping our patients with it, depending of course very much on the state of our own disavowal."

Drawing on key theoretical approaches to climate change denial from the social sciences and humanities, this paper discusses the ideological dimension and, more especially, the anthropocentric denial underlying our failure to respond to climate change. We argue that the speciesist anthropocentrism inherent in the current dominant ethics is what prevents humanity from reacting to the main human-induced drivers of global warming. Encouraged to do so by current mainstream ethics, humans overpopulate the planet, grow at the expense of other species, and indulge in cruel, unhealthy and unsustainable practices. We counterpose this ethics against the egalitarian, non-speciesist approach of the animal ethics movement, positing that it represents the next radical reflexive movement and could be used to break the climate deadlock. Animal ethics allows links with inegalitarianism and privilege that may help address climate contrarianism and climate inaction much more effectively."

Two-thirds of global industrial greenhouse gas emissions over the past two centuries can be traced to the activities of a handful of companies, most of which belong to this industry. Emissions generated by oil and gas companies’ products and processes have significantly increased the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. To add to this, some of the oil and gas majors have funded, shaped, and advanced climate denial. Through this behaviour, these companies have besmirched the entire industry and substantially contributed to paralysing global climate policy for decades. In brief, the oil and gas industry has – either directly through emissions or indirectly through denial – played a major role in anthropogenic climate change, the impacts of which are causing serious harm to humanity and the planet. This article carries out a review of the relevant literature in order to explore and justify this claim, as well as to lay the groundwork for analysing the consequent moral and political implications. It opens by overviewing the oil and gas industry, before going on to focus on the contentious and inconsistent process that led oil and gas companies to – grudgingly, and in a limited fashion – acknowledge climate change, a vivid testament to their awkward coexistence. Thereafter, the article turns its attention to the oil and gas companies’ direct contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions; and finally on how their efforts to upend accepted climate science through denial has been a powerful indirect contributing factor to climate change."

The gravity of the situation only appears to be growing as recent reports have shown that climate change denial is not limited to the United States and that other global citizens also appear to be confused regarding the legitimacy of climate change science data. The prevalence of confusion highlights the dire need for better educational programs and grassroots actions by the scientific and academic communities. However, the path from 'data' to citizen action is hardly a direct one, and thus the engagement of the climate science community (ENGOs and other boundary organizations, academia, governments) in education will not be simply one of 'getting the word out'. That community will need to grapple with the complex socio-epstemic space that lies between scientific knowledge production and citizens' participatory engagement with climate change policies. This paper outlines some aspects of that complexity and suggests ways how certain types of knowledge dissemination as such, which lead to increased scientific literacy, can contribute to increased citizen action."

The term agnostic adaptation has emerged to refer to actions that address climate change’s effects without acknowledging its existence or human causes. Although prevalent, agnostic adaptation has yet to be the focus of significant empirical research. Most studies of climate silence and denial examine the absence of action rather than its paradoxical presence. This article, by contrast, explores how action and silence coexist and even serve to reinforce each other. It draws on fieldwork in Staten Island, New York City’s most politically conservative and only predominantly white borough, where residents mobilized after Hurricane Sandy in favor of government buyouts of their damaged homes that would pay them to relocate rather than rebuild in place. The areas that received buyouts have been lauded from afar as exemplary sites of community-led climate adaptation in one of its most radical forms, managed retreat. On the ground, however, those who participated in the push for retreat were largely silent on the topic of climate change, which was not seen as politically enabling or efficacious to discuss. Agnostic adaptation minimized conflict, made for more tractable claims, and maintained relations of power but in so doing offered protection to only a select few. These findings point to the practical effects of climate silence as it exists in relation to climate talk, both of which share omissions, erasures, and forms of agnosticism that narrow the space for transformative action."

McCright and Dunlap argue that climate change denial can be understood as an expression of protecting group identity and justifying a societal system that provides desired benefits. Our findings resemble those in the US study. A total of 63 per cent of conservative males in Norway do not believe in anthropogenic climate change, as opposed to 36 per cent among the rest of the population who deny climate change and global warming. Expanding on the US study, we investigate whether conservative males more often hold what we term xenosceptic views, and if that adds to the ‘cool dude-effect’.1 Multivariate logistic regression models reveal strong effects from a variable measuring ‘xenosceptic cool dudes’. Interpreting xenoscepticism as a rough proxy for right leaning views, climate change denial in Norway seems to merge with broader patterns of right-wing nationalism."
273,2-s2.0-85077136910,"Copyright © 2019 by the Society for Applied Anthropology.This paper examines the ""natural cycles"" explanation of climate change skepticism found among some Oklahomans. Natural cycles skepticism rejects the anthropogenic cause of climate change and asserts that observed weather changes are the result of the Earth's natural cycles. This explanation is a folk model, a type of cultural model, of the climate that makes analogic comparisons between present and past weather patterns. In this paper, we use insights from cultural model theory to examine the logic of the natural cycles explanation. Cultural models provide the basis for analogic thought, which is a common cognitive strategy people use to compare new experiences and concepts to unfamiliar ones. However, analogic thought is a double-edged sword because it may map relationships from the familiar to the novel that do not hold or leave important factors associated with a new experience unrecognized. In this instance, analogies drawn with the natural cycles model between past and current experience with extreme weather do not account for important changes, such as increased greenhouse gas emissions and technological changes. This can lead to inferences about the present and future that differ from scientific consensus. Since the strongest signals of climate change are still remote phenomena for most Oklahomans, holders of the natural cycles model may not yet perceive incongruences between their models and experience. A direct challenge to the natural cycles model is likely to fail because it is connected to holders' lived and learned experience as well as their conception about the world. Therefore, we include a recommendation for using analogy to frame arguments for the anthropogenic nature of climate change that are based on Oklahomans' lived experiences and that may be useful in facilitating some Oklahomans' reconceptualization of humanity's influence on the climate."

All rights reserved.One of the most discussed problems regarding climate science is that the knowledge it claims to have is plagued by uncertainty. Timothy Morton’s dark ecology regards uncertainty as inextricable from any knowledge and also from any relation in general. This approach reveals that a rejection of uncertainty motivates both climate change deniers and their critics who would treat the conclusions of climate science as indisputable facts. Instead of treating uncertainty as a problem, dark ecology proposes that we learn how to live with it. But in order to do so, it recommends not only becoming attuned to the weird, “dark” side of things, but also tacitly suggests that the dark side is the only real one. Dark ecology is therefore bound to disregard those realms of human existence which are dependent upon transparency, such as public and political life. However, the article shows that particular processes in those realms have contributed significantly to the way the weird reality described by dark ecology became perceptible. Many of the features of global warming that dark ecology emphasizes — the impossibility of distancing oneself from it or of defining it completely and controlling it — become apparent only when a broad public controversy about its reality emerges and that controversy can never be resolved by citing allegedly certain facts The participants in such a controversy find that is impossible to convert the knowledge they have into a consensus. The article recommends taking that experience as a step toward attuning oneself to weird reality in which knowledge is more impotence than power."

Holling, face significant methodological contradictions; for instance, they must cope with the problem that ecological models and theories of climate change, resilience and succession cannot make predictions in open systems. Generally, they respond to this problem by supplementing their empirical realism with transcendental idealism: they therefore say that their models are simply metaphorical or heuristic, that is, 'not true' in that they are not empirical. Thus, they explicitly deny an ontology for what their models are about. Nevertheless, in their practice, ecologists act as if their theories do have an ontology and thus tell us something truthful about the real world. This discrepancy leaves ecology vulnerable to unnecessary critique, such as that climate science is not real science. Transcendental realism offers a solution because it releases ecologists from the requirement to make predictions; but it does so without denying ontology. This provides several advantages to ecologists."

Hence, we investigate frank speech as updated ancient forms of truth-telling ‘parrhesia’, in two Swedish empirical sources that strongly question the climate change consensus. The first is a digital space for free speech, and the second a focus group of climate skeptics. Tracing ‘epistemic skepticism’ and ‘response skepticism’, we inquire into the attempts to counter scientific expertise and the different ways to refuse to act in accordance with officially sanctioned advice. We analyze the details of climate cynic truth-telling in relation to truth-telling as provocation, as ethical practice and as exhibition of a specific aim. We explore how the climate skeptic turns into a climate cynic, and discuss how alternative truth construction forms an anti-climate ethical selfhood. We end by problematizing how parrhesia is linked to ethical relativism, and argue that the recognition of climate cynicism facilitates our understanding of how conflicting political realities about climate change are produced."

It is accepted that people are generally worried about global warming. However, it is also a fact that there is a small but increasing number of climate change skeptics. These skeptics do not believe that there is any risk, nor are they concerned with other worrisome facts related to climate change. Skeptics regard the present scientific findings supporting climate change as false artefacts. Our study aimed to explore the factors that influence climate skepticism. In this work, to make a regression model, we established environmental skepticism as a dependent variable and included sociodemographic factors, values, and perception factors as the three independent variables. Also, to examine their roles indirectly, we regarded values as moderators.

Also, values such as ideology, religiosity, environmentalism, and cultural biases play a moderating role that facilitates, buffers, or changes the effect of psychometric variables on an individual's skepticism."

Geographers have engaged with the politics of climate science, the dissemination of scientific knowledge, and how the dominant discourse of climate science frames the debate as apolitical, but they have not directed much attention to climate skeptic literature itself. I suggest that despite this lacunae, geographers have developed the necessary tools to understand climate skeptic literature as neither simply ignorance nor intentionally deceitful—at least not always. I further suggest that the burgeoning literature on “geohumanities,” along with its intellectual predecessors in geography, is particularly adept at reading how the skeptic literature narrates the relationship between knowledge, power, and space. I focus my attention on several prominent texts in the climate skeptic literature—not to vindicate them but to understand their ideological premises."

During legislative processes, both the elite and general citizens can develop resistance towards such policies. The article considers those two perspectives and determines, on both levels, factors that explain opposition. We also specifically take into account whether climate change skepticism, i.e., questioning that climate change is real and human-induced, is a key factor that leads to opposition. Furthermore, we employ structural equation models to account for interactions between the elite and general citizens. The results show that political actors who reject the idea of man-made climate change also oppose the promotion of a clean energy transition, and more generally that elite actors influence how citizens think about the issue. At the citizen level, an increase in climate change skepticism has a negative impact on levels of support for clean energy policy. The link is mainly determined by party affiliation. We conclude that potential strategies for achieving a clean energy transition should focus on motivating citizens because they generally seem to be less polarized and partisan, and thus less opposed to new solutions, than the elite, who tend to be more constrained in their actions."

In responding to this question, we conduct a discourse network analysis which identifies relations between actors, objects, phenomena, and processes, and points out differences/similarities across a continuum of exemplary far-right sources. The investigated actors put forward a rather skeptical climate change narrative, even though differences exist as the significance attached to the Volk and its sovereignty, rooted in far-right ideology, sometimes overrides, and sometimes is in harmony with, their ideological-driven affinity with nature protection.

This study applies qualitative content analysis to 340 documents from the conservative think tank, the Heartland Institute, to test whether certain policy frames have become more common among leading opponents of climate policy in the United States. The results indicate a continued reliance on science framing, with more directed attacks on climate scientists and fewer frames stressing the uncertainty of climate science.

Thus, the study of group processes and intergroup relations is critical to understanding the myriad of barriers to addressing this large-scale problem.

With its attention to the interactive dimensions of social order between individuals, social norms, cultural systems and political economy, the discipline of sociology is uniquely positioned to be an important leader in this conversation. In this paper I suggest that in order to understand and respond to climate change we need two kinds of imagination: 1) to see the relationships between human actions and their impacts on earth's biophysical system (ecological imagination) and 2) to see the relationships within society that make up this environmentally damaging social structure (sociological imagination). The scientific community has made good progress in developing our ecological imagination but still need to develop a sociological imagination. The application of a sociological imagination allows for a powerfully reframing of four key problems in the current interdisciplinary conversation on climate change: why climate change is happening, how we are being impacted, why we have failed to successfully respond so far, and how we might be able to effectively do so. I visit each of these four questions describing the current understanding and show the importance of the sociological imagination and other insights from the field of sociology. I close with reflections on current limitations in sociology's potential to engage climate change and the Anthropocene."

Telling the truth in this way carried a political force that their previous advocacy did not. These figures help animate and adapt Foucault’s notion of spiritual truth for climate change.

For example, misinformation about climate change has confused the public and stalled support for mitigation policies. When people lack the expertise and skill to evaluate the science behind a claim, they typically rely on heuristics such as substituting judgment about something complex (i.e. climate science) with judgment about something simple (i.e. the character of people who speak about climate science) and are therefore vulnerable to misleading information. Inoculation theory offers one approach to effectively neutralize the influence of misinformation. Typically, inoculations convey resistance by providing people with information that counters misinformation. In contrast, we propose inoculating against misinformation by explaining the fallacious reasoning within misleading denialist claims. We offer a strategy based on critical thinking methods to analyse and detect poor reasoning within denialist claims. This strategy includes detailing argument structure, determining the truth of the premises, and checking for validity, hidden premises, or ambiguous language. Focusing on argument structure also facilitates the identification of reasoning fallacies by locating them in the reasoning process. Because this reason-based form of inoculation is based on general critical thinking methods, it offers the distinct advantage of being accessible to those who lack expertise in climate science. We applied this approach to 42 common denialist claims and find that they all demonstrate fallacious reasoning and fail to refute the scientific consensus regarding anthropogenic global warming. This comprehensive deconstruction and refutation of the most common denialist claims about climate change is designed to act as a resource for communicators and educators who teach climate science and/or critical thinking."

Design/methodology/approach: The paper illustrates a range of current and projected climate change scenarios in Florida, the challenges the state is already experiencing in dealing with the impacts of climate change and some of the measures adopted to date in three particularly vulnerable coastal destinations, namely Fort Lauderdale, Miami Beach and Sarasota. Findings: Although tourism is the number one industry in Florida, the state holds a particularly vulnerable position with respect to climate change. The vacuum of political will to address these issues at the state level is thus of particular concern given the vulnerable position of Florida’s coastal areas. With nearly 10 percent of its land area lying at less than one meter above the present sea level, adaptation is especially urgent in Florida. The local government of Florida’s cities such as Fort Lauderdale, Miami Beach and Sarasota are not willing to surrender to sea level rise (SLR). However, without a strong political will to address climate change at the state and federal levels, the costs of adapting to an escalating SLR are becoming progressively unsustainable. Originality/value: This illustrative case study paper provides a contemporary synthesis of the implications for Florida’s coastal tourism destinations of rising sea levels and those adaptation strategies deemed appropriate in the search for their longer-term sustainability."

Our results show a moderate correlation between the general population’s concerns and the professional views on the subject, known in the literature as the New Environmental Paradigm scale and Scepticism scale, but a significantly weaker correlation when it comes to taking action against climate change. Factors relating to the respondents, such as residence settlement type, education level, gender, age, personal and social values, or casual attributions in relation to climate change heavily influence this weaker correlation. Most respondents assessed climate change as a current (urgent), but geographically remote phenomenon. This is a clear indication of problems associated with cognitive conceptualization and the localization of climate change in communication. The target audience must be taken into account when designing climate change communications because interpretations of climate change can vary widely and cover a broad range attitudes ranging from concern about to issue all the way to climate change scepticism.

It varies between individuals, communities, and administrative levels, and in degrees of importance. Furthermore, perception can be good or bad, positive or negative, yes or no, right or wrong, belief or disbelief, or even true or false. In parallel to perception, ‘skepticism’ is referred to in literature and practice, and is a corollary to understanding human interaction in environmental communication. A review of the perception-associated literature and anecdotes collected from researchers and practitioners reveals that there is no clear definition of the remit of these two terms. At least not when it comes down to research and its application in controversial topics and scenarios cropping from sustainable development and climate change, which are two of the most multi- and interdisciplinary fields in their own individual right. The purpose of the paper is to identify and propose the definitional boundaries between perception and skepticism in a systematic manner, and propose a conceptual model in the form of a schematic. Based on illustrative case studies, the paper also paves a path for further research areas in which the conceptual model can be applied to real-world scenarios for testing and sensitivity analysis, whereas such scenarios can come from the multi- and interdisciplinary fields of sustainability and climate change. This way, the environmental communication can be rendered more effective and efficient between diverse and wide range of stakeholders, particularly including decision makers. The paper also concludes that skepticism is relatively a newer term as opposed to perception needing to be carefully employed and, not confused and readily interchangeably used with perception."
302,2-s2.0-84988345817,"© 2016, The Author(s).Science strives for coherence. For example, the findings from climate science form a highly coherent body of knowledge that is supported by many independent lines of evidence: greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from human economic activities are causing the global climate to warm and unless GHG emissions are drastically reduced in the near future, the risks from climate change will continue to grow and major adverse consequences will become unavoidable. People who oppose this scientific body of knowledge because the implications of cutting GHG emissions—such as regulation or increased taxation—threaten their worldview or livelihood cannot provide an alternative view that is coherent by the standards of conventional scientific thinking. Instead, we suggest that people who reject the fact that the Earth’s climate is changing due to greenhouse gas emissions (or any other body of well-established scientific knowledge) oppose whatever inconvenient finding they are confronting in piece-meal fashion, rather than systematically, and without considering the implications of this rejection to the rest of the relevant scientific theory and findings. Hence, claims that the globe “is cooling” can coexist with claims that the “observed warming is natural” and that “the human influence does not matter because warming is good for us.” Coherence between these mutually contradictory opinions can only be achieved at a highly abstract level, namely that “something must be wrong” with the scientific evidence in order to justify a political position against climate change mitigation. This high-level coherence accompanied by contradictory subordinate propositions is a known attribute of conspiracist ideation, and conspiracism may be implicated when people reject well-established scientific propositions."

While studies of the influence of fatalism on disaster preparedness are common, the ways in which fatalism influences climate change skepticism, and in turn affects farmers’ interest in crop insurance, have not been previously investigated. An additional objective was to understand farmers’ preferences for index versus standard insurance options, the former entailing damage compensation based on post-hazard assessment, the latter tying damage compensation to a set of weather parameter thresholds. A discrete choice experiment was conducted with maize farmers on a climate-risk prone island in coastal Bangladesh. Most farmers were insurance averse. Those who chose insurance were however significantly more likely to select standard as opposed to index-based insurance. Insurance demand was significantly and positively correlated with farmers’ concern about the adverse livelihood impacts of climate change. Farmers who exhibited fatalistic views regarding the consequences of climate change were significantly less likely to opt for insurance of either kind. These findings imply that the prospect for farmers’ investment in insurance is conditioned by their understanding of climate change risks and the utility of adaptation, in addition to insurance scheme design."

In the area of environmental science and policy though, the research on denial has not been systematically summarized and analyzed. This article reviews 161 scientific articles on environmental and climate science denial published in peer reviewed international journals in the last 25 years and aims to both identify research gaps and enable learning on the phenomenon. Such knowledge is needed for the increasingly important task to provide effective response to science denial, in order to put an end to its influence on environmental policy making. The review, which is based on articles found in the databases Web of Science, Scopus and Philosopher's Index, shows that denial by far is most studied in relation to climate change, with a focus on Anglo-American countries, where this form of denial is most common. Other environmental issues and other geographical areas have received much less scientific attention. While the actors behind climate science denial, their various motives and the characteristics of their operations have been thoroughly described, more comparative research between issues and countries is needed in order to draw reliable conclusions about the factors explaining the peculiarities of denial. This may in turn lay the ground for developing and actually testing the effectiveness and efficiency of strategies to counter environmental science denial. Irrespective of the ambitions of environmental goals, science-based policies are always preferable. The scientific community therefore needs to increase its efforts to dismantle false claims and to disclose the schemes of denialists."

Recent studies have shown farmers’ beliefs about climate change to be influential in their support for adopting these practices. This study explores how social groups and their climate change messages interact with regional biophysical expressions of climate change to influence farmers’ climate change beliefs. We apply a recently revised realist framework to qualitative data from 104 interviews with corn farmers in Iowa and Indiana, United States (US). Our findings illustrate that many farmers are able to detect the biophysical expressions of climate change; however, their acknowledgement of the impacts of climate change in most cases does not translate into an acknowledgement of the anthropogenic nature of climate change. Conflicting social messages produce uncertainty about or disbelief in humans’ causal role. These results show that realist frameworks, like the one applied here, can serve as useful guides for analyses and intervention related to climate change mitigation."

We present an empirical document-by-document textual content analysis and comparison of 187 climate change communications from ExxonMobil, including peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed publications, internal company documents, and paid, editorial-style advertisements ('advertorials') in The New York Times. We examine whether these communications sent consistent messages about the state of climate science and its implications - specifically, we compare their positions on climate change as real, human-caused, serious, and solvable. In all four cases, we find that as documents become more publicly accessible, they increasingly communicate doubt. This discrepancy is most pronounced between advertorials and all other documents. For example, accounting for expressions of reasonable doubt, 83% of peer-reviewed papers and 80% of internal documents acknowledge that climate change is real and human-caused, yet only 12% of advertorials do so, with 81% instead expressing doubt. We conclude that ExxonMobil contributed to advancing climate science - by way of its scientists' academic publications - but promoted doubt about it in advertorials. Given this discrepancy, we conclude that ExxonMobil misled the public. Our content analysis also examines ExxonMobil's discussion of the risks of stranded fossil fuel assets. We find the topic discussed and sometimes quantified in 24 documents of various types, but absent from advertorials.

We bring three broad areas of literature into conversation in order to think more productively about climate change and emotion: recent applications of the concept of emotional labour, studies of the role of emotion in science, and feminist perspectives on the performative role of emotions. In response to contextual drivers that include the social norms of science, a strong climate denialist influence and the preservation of self and family, these scientists mobilize a range of behaviours and strategies to manage their emotions around climate change and the future. These include emphasizing dispassion, suppressing painful emotions, using humour and switching off from work. Emotional denial or suppression of the consequences of climate change worked to enable the scientists to persevere in their work.

To explore this issue, we report on a preliminary study investigating two prominent messaging styles: consensus and targeted messages. While consensus messaging did not produce significant effects, targeted messages emphasizing free market solutions to climate change were effective at improving conservatives’ climate change acceptance. Furthermore, the inclusion of consensus information did not improve or diminish the effects of the targeted messages. These findings underscore the utility of targeted messaging in improving climate change acceptance among political conservatives."

A quantitative content analysis of a broad newspaper sample for each country over the course of one year (June 2012–May 2013) was conducted. The results reveal that conservative newspapers do not amplify skeptical voices in general; the difference between conservative and more liberal outlets is only found in the case of impact and response skepticism. Second, in each country, certain conservative newspapers are particularly open to skeptical arguments."

Ninety per cent claim climate change is occurring, yet almost one third claim climate change has ‘natural‘ causes. Women, ’global citizens’, those who mainly consume public broadcast news and those with high self-assessed knowledge of climate change are most likely to believe that climate change is occurring and has mainly anthropogenic causes. As in other advanced industrialised countries, political divisions over the causes of climate change run deep in Australia. Australians who identify with conservative political parties are far more likely than those aligned with other parties to reject anthropogenic climate change, with conservative men, those living in rural areas, and on the right of ideological spectrum most likely to believe climate change is happening, but has mainly ‘natural’ causes. Politically conservative Australians remain sceptical of the risks of climate change, although even the majority of conservatives believe that climate change will seriously threaten the lifestyles of the next generation."

Roughly one third of Americans are skeptical that humans are primarily responsible for climate change; rates of some infectious diseases are climbing in the face of antiimmunization beliefs; and significant numbers of the population worldwide are antievolution creationists. It is easy to assume that resistance to an evidence-based message is a result of ignorance or failure to grasp evidence (the ""deficit model"" of science communication). But increasingly, theorists understand there are limits to this approach, and that if people are motivated to reject science, then repeating evidence will have little impact. In an effort to create a transtheoretical language for describing these underlying motivations, we introduce the notion of ""attitude roots."" Attitude roots are the underlying fears, ideologies, worldviews, and identity needs that sustain and motivate specific ""surface"" attitudes like climate skepticism and creationism. It is the antiscience attitude that people hear and see, but it is the attitude root-what lies under the surface-that allows the surface attitudes to survive even when they are challenged by evidence. We group these attitude roots within 6 themes- worldviews, conspiratorial ideation, vested interests, personal identity expression, social identity needs, and fears and phobias-and review literature relevant to them. We then use these insights to develop a ""jiu jitsu"" model of persuasion that places emphasis on creating change by aligning with (rather than competing with) these attitude roots."

Unfortunately for public knowledge, such findings don’t appear in the news. Sea levels too have not been obeying the ‘grand transnational narrative’ of catastrophic global warming. Sea levels around Australia 2011–2012 were measured with the most significant drops in sea levels since measurements began. This phenomenon was due to rainfall over Central Australia, which filled vast inland lakes. It was not predicted in the models, nor was it reported in the news. The 2015–2016 El-Niño, a natural phenomenon, drove sea levels around Indonesia to low levels such that coral reefs were bleaching. The echo chamber of news repeatedly fails to report such phenomena and yet many studies continue to contradict mainstream news discourse. Whistle-blower Dr. John Bates exposed the U.S. National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) when it manipulated data to meet politically predetermined conclusions for the 2015 Paris (Climate) Agreement.

We focus on mass media as the conveyors of the image of climate change and ask: Is climate change skepticism still a characteristic of US print media coverage? If so, to what degree and in what form? And which factors might pave the way for skeptics entering mass media debates? We conducted a quantitative content analysis of US print media during one year (1 June 2012 to 31 May 2013). Our results show that the debate has changed: fundamental forms of climate change skepticism (such as denial of anthropogenic causes) have been abandoned in the coverage, being replaced by more subtle forms (such as the goal to avoid binding regulations). We find no evidence for the norm of journalistic balance, nor do our data support the idea that it is the conservative press that boosts skepticism."
318,2-s2.0-85007575170,"We postulate that skepticism about climate change is partially caused by the spatial heterogeneity of climate change, which exposes experiential learners to climate heuristics that differ from the global average. This hypothesis is tested by formalizing an index that measures local changes in climate using station data and comparing this index with survey-based model estimates of county-level opinion about whether global warming is happening. Results indicate that more stations exhibit cooling and warming than predicted by random chance and that spatial variations in these changes can account for spatial variations in the percentage of the population that believes that ""global warming is happening."" This effect is diminished in areas that have experienced more record low temperatures than record highs since 2005. Together, these results suggest that skepticism about climate change is driven partially by personal experiences; an accurate heuristic for local changes in climate identifies obstacles to communicating ongoing changes in climate to the public and how these communications might be improved."

Previous research on climate change beliefs conceptualizes political views along a spectrum, from right-wing party members to moderates to left-wing party members or along a left-right ideological scale. Findings indicate that conventional assumptions about political identification and climate change beliefs vary in the two cities. In Copenhagen, respondents in right-wing parties have higher rates of climate change denial compared to the politically unaffiliated, but those on the left do not have lower rates. While left-leaning respondents in Houston have lower odds of climate change denial than moderates, right-leaning respondents do not have higher rates of denial. These results suggest that individual-level political beliefs do not always have a continuous effect on climate change attitudes. The findings in these two divergent cities–one a green capital, the other an oil and gas hub–suggest the need for greater interest in examining climate change beliefs in cities."

One reason for this is that misinformation about climate science is widespread in the society. It should be noted, however, that some individuals are more prone to denying climate change than others. As reviewed in this contribution, different psychological mechanisms could explain this variance in climate change denial. For example, complexity of the topic or efforts to decrease negative emotions may explain some part of the variation. Importantly, however, it has been found that sociopolitical ideology has a particularly important role in explaining climate change denial. This is of importance, because ideologically motivated rejection of science cannot be addressed solely by focusing on communicating science. Rather, the underlying concerns and motivational needs that cause the rejection should be addressed. For instance, environmental messages may threaten some individuals’ ideological convictions and social identity. Sociopolitical ideology has been shown to include two components: resistance to/acceptance of change and acceptance of/rejection of inequality. Recent research findings suggest that, although both of these components are likely to explain climate change denial, the latter seems to play a particularly central role. Based on the psychological mechanism explaining climate change denial, possible communication strategies have been proposed."

But critics claimed that the scientific uncertainties were too great to justify the expense, and the inconvenience of eliminating greenhouse gas emissions, and climate change denial spread widely by the end of the millennium. The year 2009 is viewed as the ""last best chance"" for the Western world to save itself, as leaders met in Copenhagen, Denmark, to try to agree on a binding, international law to prevent disruptive climate change. However, in 2023, the leaders still refused to accept that what lay behind the increasing destructiveness of disasters was the burning of fossil fuels."

However, this did not occur in two distinct communication actor-networks, Russia and Canada, raising questions regarding climate change journalism and agenda-setting in contemporary networked news environments. This article takes a fresh approach to studying agenda-setting processes by using ANT to trace connections between national climate agendas, networks of power and sites of mediated information. By mapping ties between attributes of DT story actornetworks, it illuminates moments that preclude or facilitate intermedia agenda-setting in online media networks.

Specifically, those with right-of-centre political views are typically less concerned and more sceptical about climate change. A significant challenge remains to move beyond this ideological impasse and achieve a more open and constructive debate across the political spectrum. This paper reports on novel mixed-methods research in the UK to develop and test a series of ‘narratives’ to better engage citizens with centre-right political views. Qualitative work in Study 1 revealed two particularly promising narratives. The first focused on the idea that saving energy is predicated on the ‘conservative’ principle of avoiding waste; the second focused on the advantages of ‘Great British Energy’ (based on patriotic support for domestic low-carbon technologies). An online experiment in Study 2 with a representative UK sample compared these narratives with a more typically left-of-centre narrative focused on the concept of ‘climate justice’ with a representative sample of the UK public. Results indicate that the first two narratives elicited broad agreement and reduced scepticism amongst centre-right participants, while the ‘climate justice’ narrative (which reflects a common environmental message framing) polarised audiences along political lines. This research offers clear implications for how climate change communicators can move beyond preaching to the converted and initiate constructive dialogue about climate change with traditionally disengaged audiences."

The analysis shows how journalists, and their interpretations and professional norms, shape media debates about climate change. The study links an analysis of media content to a survey of the authors of the respective articles. It covers leading print and online news outlets in Germany, India, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Switzerland. It finds that climate journalism has moved beyond the norm of balance towards a more interpretive pattern of journalism. Quoting contrarian voices still is part of transnational climate coverage, but these quotes are contextualized with a dismissal of climate change denial. Yet niches of denial persist in certain contexts, and much journalistic attention is focused on the narrative of ‘warners vs. deniers,’ and overlooks the more relevant debates about climate change."

Local policies are determined by expectations of policy makers about future climate. There are three types of expectations: strong skeptic, weak skeptic and ‘science-based’. Strong skeptics deny human-induced climate change and a possibility of a climate catastrophe. Weak skeptics believe that industrial emissions cause global warming, but deny catastrophic climate change. Science-based policy makers, considering the warning of the scientific community, account for both: human influence on climate and possible catastrophic shifts. Aggregate behavior of policy makers determines the total emission level which influences global climate dynamics. The paper argues that even if there are only skeptical policy makers the climate catastrophe can still be avoided."

Three major discourses are discovered: rejecting climate science because climate science is a conspiracy favoring growth of government; opposing renewable energy and energy taxation; and expressing fear of governmental abuse of power.

Yet, climate change deniers and free-market activists are as staunchly opposed to market-based climate policy as they are to any other form of climate mitigation. In order to understand why climate change deniers reject market-based policy proposals, an archive of free-market environmental newsletters was analyzed for themes of economic opposition. This analysis revealed how climate change deniers rely upon the concept of a regulatory cartel to connect economic opposition to climate policy with attacks on scientific evidence. Because professional scientists do not operate under conventional private-market incentive structures, neoliberal climate change deniers frame scientific knowledge as an attack on economic freedom when utilized to guide policy governing environment–economy relationships."

Consequently, it is important to examine the psychological drivers of pro-environmental intentions among attribution skeptics and the extent to which they are more or less influenced by traditional climate change messages. Study 1 (N = 4,345) examined the psychological correlates of motivation to engage in pro-environmental behaviors among people at various points of the spectrum of belief in anthropogenic climate change. As expected, motivation to engage in pro-environmental behaviors is related to risk perceptions and concern about the consequences of climate change. Interestingly, however, these links were stronger the more participants reported being skeptical that climate change is anthropogenic. This suggests that climate change interventions might be especially successful in changing pro-environmental motivation among attribution skeptics, a prediction supported by an experimental intervention (Study 2; N = 600).

The study is situated in a delta area with substantial geographic variations in the occurrence and potential impact of flood risk, which has led to initiatives to make the area more “climate proof.” We developed a research model that examines individual differences in processing information about climate change related flood risk, based on the postulate that individuals often make an implicit trade-off between motivation to know “what is real” and motivation to maintain prior beliefs. A field experiment, embedded in a survey (n = 1887), sought to test out how the participants responded to risk frames in which a story on flood was either or not combined with climate change information. The results show that it was possible to increase the participants’ local climate risk perception in combination with increased motivation for flood damage prevention, despite a certain level of climate change skepticism. A general implication of our study is that relevant and diagnostic information about local climate-related flood risks can stimulate citizens’ need to know “what’s real” and their willingness to take responsibility for preparedness."

A better understanding of contrarian discourse is therefore called for. We report a blind expert test of contrarian claims about climatological variables. Expert economists and statisticians were presented with representative contrarian statements (e.g., ""Arctic ice is recovering"") translated into an economic or demographic context.

The title ""ethics of belief"" comes from a 19th-century paper written by British philosopher and mathematician W.K. Clifford. Clifford argues that we are morally responsible for our beliefs because (a) each belief that we form creates the cognitive circumstances for related beliefs to follow, and (b) we inevitably influence each other through those beliefs. This study argues that recent cognitive research supports Cliffordian insights regarding patterns of belief formation and social influence. From the confirmation offered by such research, it follows that informational accuracy holds serious ethical significance in public discourse. Although scientific and epistemological matters are not always thought to be linked to normative morality, this study builds on Clifford's initial insights to show their linkage is fundamental to inquiry itself. In turn, Clifford's ethical and epistemic outline can inform a framework grounded in ""public reason"" under which seemingly opposed science communication strategies (e.g., ""information deficit"" and ""cultural cognition"" models) are philosophically united. With public discourse on climate change as the key example, empirically informed and grounded strategies for science communication in the public sphere are considered."

341,2-s2.0-84994545705,"In this paper I claim that there are moral reasons for making climate denialism illegal. First I define climate denialism, and then I discuss its impact on society and its reception in the media. I build my philosophical arguments mainly on John Stuart Mill and Thomas M. Scanlon. According to Mill's utilitarian justification of free speech, even untrue opinions are valuable in society's pursuit of more truth. Consequently one might think that Mill's philosophy would justify climate denialists' right to free speech. A major section of the paper argues against that view. The main arguments are: Climate denialism is not beneficial because its main goal is to produce doubt, and not truth. Climate denialism is not sincerely meant, which is a necessary condition for Mill to accept utterances. Climate denialists bring harm, by blocking necessary action on climate change. Primarily they harm future generations and people in developing countries. Hence the case can be made in terms of global justice: Would future generations and people in developing countries support my claim? I think so, or so I argue. My argument from global justice is built on Scanlon's distinction between the interests of participants, the interests of audiences, and the interests of bystanders. The climate denialists have participant interests ""in being able to call something to the attention of a wide audience"". Audience interests consist of ""having access to expressions that we wish to hear or read, and even in being exposed to some degree to expressions we have not chosen"". Future generations and people in poor countries are bystanders to the climate debate. If the debate postpones necessary actions, it is the bystanders who must pay the price. I argue that bystanders' costs outweigh participants' and audiences' interests, and that this is an argument for a statutory ban on climate denialism."

Also, identification with or trust in groups representing forces of reflexivity (e.g., the environmental movement and scientific community) decreases the likelihood of such skepticism.

We conducted an experiment to examine how Americans' ACC views are influenced by four promising frames for urging action on ACC (economic opportunity, national security, Christian stewardship, and public health)-when these frames appear with an ACC denial counter-frame. This is the first direct test of how exposure to an ACC denial message influences Americans' ACC views. Overall, these four positive frames have little to no effect on ACC beliefs. But exposure to an ACC denial counter-frame does significantly reduce respondents' belief in the reality of ACC, belief about the veracity of climate science, awareness of the consequences of ACC, and support for aggressively attempting to reduce our nation's GHG emissions in the near future. Furthermore, as expected by the Anti-Reflexivity Thesis, exposure to the ACC denial counter-frame has a disproportionate influence on the ACC views of conservatives (than on those of moderates and liberals), effectively activating conservatives' underlying propensity for anti-reflexivity."

In this study, we focus on the potential influences of astroturf organizations within the context of prosocial behaviors. Building on the notion that deceptive advertisements engender distrust and undermine the trustworthiness of subsequent advertising, we suggest that people who read messages from astroturf organizations will become more distrustful toward nonprofit organizations and will display lower willingness to engage in prosocial behaviors than people who read messages from grassroots organizations. Results from studies 1 and 2 indicate that messages from astroturf organizations can engender people’s distrust toward nonprofit organizations, thereby lowering their willingness to engage in prosocial behaviors. In addition, the negative effect of astroturf organizations is moderated by skepticism toward advertising. Given that the insidious use of astroturf organizations is growing in popularity, we provide meaningful insights into the influence of fake grassroots organizations, with the possibility to forewarn the public about their undesirable effects on the community."

I argue that even denial formed in ignorance of the organised misinformation campaign often constitutes a kind of arrogance, but that it is quite possible to humbly doubt the climate change problem. In some cases denial flows from other more or less serious errors or vices, such as ignorance, sincere but mistaken belief, dishonesty or selfishness. Those who press the arrogance charge also risk being arrogant in doing so. Educators can do a number of things to promote greater humility about climate change, including providing experiences that increase people’s appreciation of their individual and general human limitations and improving their ability to distinguish credible from discreditable sources of scientific information and factual from normative dimensions of the climate change problem."

These attitudes have been explained with a variety of factors, including cultural worldviews, environmental attitudes, political ideology, knowledge of climate change, severe weather exposure, and sociodemographic characteristics. These studies typically assume an individual forms attitudes on the basis of preexisting values or beliefs and do not account for dynamic social interaction as a source of influence. This study introduces a network perspective that accounts for the social embeddedness of individuals, using network variables to predict climate attitudes, including homophily, network strength, attitude diversity, centrality, network size, and network valence. An exploratory factor analysis identified two distinct attitudinal dimensions: climate change epistemic skepticism and belief strength. Using egocentric data from a nationally representative survey collected in 2011, this study found that network variables were significant in predicting both climate attitude dimensions; hierarchical regression analyses accounting for other known predictors found two different predictive models for epistemic skepticism and belief strength. Homophily, network strength, attitude diversity, and network valence predicted epistemic skepticism (R2change=4.8%), while centrality and network strength predicted belief strength (R2change=8.9%). The analyses also found support for cultural factors as significant predictors of climate attitudes, particularly Christianity and cultural worldviews. The results of this study suggest that interpersonal influence through communication networks is a promising avenue for continued research, and should be included in studies of climate attitude formation and change."
350,2-s2.0-84934953481,"© 2015 Elsevier B.V..Extending previous research, we examined whether the relation between social dominance orientation (SDO) and climate change denial reflects group-based dominance (SDO and nature dominance) or general system justification. Moreover, we examined whether the relation between personality (domineering and empathy) and denial is mediated by group-based dominance variables. The results showed that the group-based dominance variables reduce the effect of system justification on denial to nonsignificant. Also, social dominance and nature dominance explain unique parts of the variance in denial. Moreover, path analyses showed that the relations between empathy and system justification with denial are mediated by both of the group-based dominance variables, while the relation between domineering and denial is mediated only by SDO. Together, these results suggest that denial is driven partly by dominant personality and low empathy, and partly by motivation to justify and promote existing social and human-nature hierarchies. We conclude by suggesting that climate change mitigation efforts could be more successful if framed as being clearly beneficial for everybody and nonthreatening to existing social order."

This paper seeks to broaden the scholarship by examining the Chinese case, and to bridge this body of literature with nationalism. Through critical discourse analysis of Chinese publications, I demonstrate the existence of an undercurrent of climate change skepticism in China. The main discursive patterns follow a conspiracy theory that sees climate change as a western plot to constrain China’s development space and to create a new site for financial accumulation. The result suggests that Chinese climate change skepticism stems from identity politics and mistrust towards Western countries. In China’s climate skepticism discourse, science also becomes a subject of national identity politics.

The controversy may be fed by the existence of scientists from other disciplines publicly casting doubt on the validity of climate science. The extent to which non-climate scientists are skeptical of climate science has not been studied via direct survey. Here we report on a survey of biophysical scientists across disciplines at universities in the Big 10 Conference. Most respondents (93.6%) believe that mean temperatures have risen and most (91.9%) believe in an anthropogenic contribution to rising temperatures. Respondents strongly believe that climate science is credible (mean credibility score 6.67/7). Those who disagree about climate change disagree over basic facts (e.g., the effects of CO2 on climate) and have different cultural and political values. These results suggest that scientists who are climate change skeptics are outliers and that the majority of scientists surveyed believe in anthropogenic climate change and that climate science is credible and mature."

These industries are similar in that some companies tried to hide or distort information showing their products were harmful. Common law claims were eventually filed to hold the corporations accountable and compensate the injured. This paper considers the important role the lawsuits played in helping establish some accountability for the industries while also noting the limitations of the lawsuits. It will be argued that the lawsuits helped create pressure for government regulation of the industries’ products but were less successful at securing compensation for the injured. Thus, the common law claims strengthened and supported administrative regulation and the adoption of industry alternatives more than they provided a means of legal redress."

We model social and political background, value orientations and the influence of CO2 emissions per capita and vulnerability to climate change upon climate scepticism, drawing upon data from the International Social Survey Programme. Substantial differences in the levels of climate scepticism are apparent between nations. Yet cross national data show that climate sceptics are not merely the mirror image of environmentalists. Typical predictors of environmental issue concern, such as education level, postmaterial value orientations and age are poor predictors of climate scepticism. Affiliation with conservative political parties, gender, being unconcerned about 'the environment' or having little trust in government are consistent predictors of scepticism. Climate change scepticism is also correlated positively with CO2 emissions and vulnerability to climate change. While high levels of scepticism have been documented among citizens of the United States, scepticism is as high or higher in countries such as Australia, Norway and New Zealand."

Here we examine the effect of such contrarian talking points on the scientific community itself. We show that although scientists are trained in dealing with uncertainty, there are several psychological reasons why scientists may nevertheless be susceptible to uncertainty-based argumentation, even when scientists recognize those arguments as false and are actively rebutting them. Specifically, we show that prolonged stereotype threat, pluralistic ignorance, and a form of projection (the third-person effect) may cause scientists to take positions that they would be less likely to take in the absence of outspoken public opposition. We illustrate the consequences of seepage from public debate into the scientific process with a case study involving the interpretation of temperature trends from the last 15 years. We offer ways in which the scientific community can detect and avoid such inadvertent seepage."
356,2-s2.0-85017086160,"© The Author(s) 2015.“Climate change scepticism” is a familiar concept in popular and scholarly discourse and generally refers to a family of arguments and individuals that reject, dispute, or question the orthodox view of the climate issue. At close range though, it is evident that the concept is often used casually, without consideration of the complexity of the category it represents. Scholars have varied interpretations of the concept and sometimes actively dispute its meaning and reach. The article proposes that the sceptic phenomenon can be variegated according to the types of sceptic critiques and, additionally, according to sceptics’ attitudinal characteristics. Taxonomies are proposed for each. The types of sceptic arguments are organised in a conceptual hierarchy consisting of two classes of critiques (“core” and “concomitant”), three centers of scepticism (“evidence,” “process,” and “response”), and seven specific objects of scepticism. For the attitudinal characteristics of sceptics, the article takes stock of the different motives, modes, and certainties of belief among sceptics. It proposes some relabeling of the category and subcategories to more accurately describe nuances in sceptic positions, as well as to dispose of unproductive labels. The article suggests how the refined conceptualisation might help observers and policy practitioners to manage the sceptic challenge in a more discerning and constructive fashion."

Our approach combines community detection with probabilistic topic modeling to show how topics related to climate change are discussed across various parts of the blogosphere. We find that there is one community of predominantly climate skeptical blogs but several accepter communities. The topic analysis reveals a series of issues that are characteristic of the climate change discourse in the blogosphere. Two topics, one related to climate change science and one related to climate change politics, are particularly important for characterizing the discourse. We also find that the distribution of topics over the communities cuts across the divide between skeptics and non-skeptics (accepters) and that there are differences in the patterns of interactions between the skeptics and different groups of accepters."

This brief rejoinder provides the balance that is missing from such climate change denial and skepticism studies on climate change and tourism. Recent research provides substantial evidence that reports on anthropogenic climate change are accurate, and that human-induced greenhouse gas emissions, including from the tourism industry, play a significant role in climate change. Some positive net effects may be experienced by some destinations in the short-term, but in the long-term all elements of the tourism system will be impacted. The expansion of tourism emissions at a rate greater than efficiency gains means that it is increasingly urgent that the tourism sector acknowledge, accept and respond to climate change.

This paper however shows that even climate skeptics have an incentive to reduce emissions: such a directional change generates information on the causes of global warming. Since the optimal policy depends upon these causes, they are valuable to know. Although increasing emissions would also generate information, that option is inferior due its irreversibility. We show that optimality can even imply that climate skeptics should actually argue for lower emissions than believers."

Climate change beliefs are commonly associated with voting behaviour, but are they associated with swings in voting behaviour? The latter are arguably more important for election outcomes. This paper investigates the predictive power of these beliefs on voting swings at the 2010 Australian federal election after controlling for a range of other related factors (demographic characteristics of voters, different worldviews about nature and the role of government, and the perceived opportunity cost of addressing climate change). Drawing on data from two nationally representative surveys of voters and data from the Australian Electoral Commission, this paper investigates relationships between climate change beliefs and voting swings at both the individual and electorate levels. At an individual level, a hypothetical 10% change in climate change beliefs was associated with a 2.6% swing from a conservative Coalition and a 2.0% swing toward Labor and 1.7% toward the Greens party, both left on the political spectrum. At the electorate level, this equates to a shift of 21 seats between the two main political parties (the Coalition and Labor) in Australia’s 150 seat parliament, after allocating Green preferences. Given many seats are marginal, even modest shifts in climate change beliefs can be associated with changes in electoral outcomes. Thus, climate change is expected to remain a politically contested issue in countries like Australia where political parties seek to distinguish themselves, in part, by their responses to climate change."

Part of the reasoning behind this approach is that it is easier to bring down individuals than an entire group of scientists, and it still serves the larger aim: to dismiss, obscure, and misrepresent well-established science and its implications. In addition, such highly visible tactics create an atmosphere of intimidation that discourages other scientists from conveying their research's implications to the public. This ""Serengeti strategy"" is often employed wherever there is a strong and widespread consensus among the world's scientists about the underlying cold, hard facts of a field, whether the subject be evolution, ozone depletion, the environmental impacts of DDT, the health effects of smoking, or human-caused climate change. The goal is to attack those researchers whose findings are inconvenient, rather than debate the findings themselves. This article draws upon the author's own experience to examine the ""Serengeti strategy,"" and offers possible countermeasures to such orchestrated campaigns.

This study attempts to identify its social bases, using a large and recent (2010) dataset that covers 45,119 individuals from 32 countries. Using multilevel modeling, it explores both individual-level and country-level influences on public environmental skepticism. The results support four individual-level perspectives (knowledge deficit, cultural orientation, social trust, and competing priority) and their interplay. Environmental skepticism stems from insufficient education and self-assessed environmental knowledge, religious and conservative values, lack of trust in general society and science, and other concerns competing with environmental concern. Moreover, the skepticism-reducing effect of education and self-assessed knowledge is found to be contingent on individuals’ religiosity and political ideologies. Education and self-assessed knowledge are more effective in reducing skepticism among less religious individuals and left-leaning liberals than among religious people and right-leaning conservatives."

This paper responds to those claims by stressing that the extent of scientific consensus suggests that human-induced warming of the climate system is unequivocal. Second, it responds in the context of tourism research and ACC, highlighting tourism's significant contribution to greenhouse gas emissions, as well as climate change's potential impacts on tourism at different scales. The paper exposes the tactics used in ACC denial papers to question climate change science by referring to non-peer-reviewed literature, outlier studies, and misinterpretation of research, as well as potential links to think tanks and interest groups. The paper concludes that climate change science does need to improve its communication strategies but that the world-view of some individuals and interests likely precludes acceptance.

The most recent period is characterized by an increase in the diversity of controversies and of ""dissonant voices"". Part of the disagreements are about climate sciences (especially climate models) and involve the recognition and stabilization of a new disciplinary field and new relationships between science and politics. Another kind of controversy concerns the domain and boundaries of climate sciences, as climate change issues reshape neighbouring scientific fields and confront different epistemic cultures.

On the contrary, other scientists who support the thesis of “Not Anthropogenic Global Warming” (NAGW), the so-called “skeptics”, such as L. Weinstain, N. Scafetta et al., affirm that the increase of CO2 coming from the various human activities will not be able to increase air temperature in the atmosphere in such a way as to cause dangerous consequences for the biosphere. For “skeptics” the rising of temperature in the atmosphere is caused mainly by a natural mechanism of the planetary system and other natural causes not strictly connected with anthropogenic activities. Moreover, they rely on theories based on the thermodynamic and physicalchemical equilibrium on the Earth’s atmosphere and based on the variation of both CO2 concentration and air temperatures down the ages. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate that both AGW and “skeptics” scientists, when analyzing the different problems caused to mankind and the biosphere were referring to only one of the two sides of the same medal. Based on this concept, the paper investigates: • the changes on the increase of CO2 in the Earth’s atmosphere both in a human and in a geological scale of time; • the most convincing theories that justify the “skeptics’” statements; • the negative effects of rising CO2 concentration in the human scale of time."

Climate disruption is a critically important agenda for homeland security and emergency management, yet as framed today, the policy communication regime frequently requires many skeptics or deniers to abandon their opinions, cultural commitments and epistemic frameworks. Public opinion consensus would be optimal, but the traditional education/information approach is flawed, and continued delays in significant mitigation and adaptation policy implementation will mean far larger future costs to protect civilian environmental security and national interests. Thus, effective response demands new messaging strategies, pursuing interim progress, leveraging overlapping consensus, enhancing risk analysis literacy, and constructing alternative, intermediary categories of multiple parallel discourse. These framings would center on security, economic interests, public health, religious stewardship, and other themes. Customized audience discourses may enable better public and opinion leader buy-in, partly transcending polarization, since such leaders have a unique ability to help translate and promote these various discourses. In addition, eventual construction of a multi-dimensional map could optimize effective messaging and supportive coalitions.

These climate sceptics tried to save an industrial society of which they were a part by defending its values against ecomodern hegemony.

It is important to examine those through different perspectives. This paper provides a philosophical analysis of how causal relations are conceived in this debate. The analysis focuses on those sceptics' arguments that do not share properties of causal relations, which are otherwise typical in science. Causal relations (a) are generic relations between event types, (b) they include feedback, (c) they account for complex causes, and (d) they are restricted to a limited number of selected factors, which are defined as event types. A two-step approach was used in structuring this analysis. First, we show that these properties are at the core of natural sciences understanding of causation and how they can be explicated on the basis of the regularity theory of causation. These properties are crucial in the argument for AGCC as depicted in the Fourth Assessment Report issued by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Therefore, IPCC's causal claim is conditional on this understanding of causal relations and, more specifically, the set of examined factors and their definitions. Second, we show how a different understanding of each of these features is a source of disagreement on AGCC by distinguishing between different types of objections, which are illustrated by examples taken from various sources including the Internet. So, pointing out different understandings of causal relations is an appropriate way of criticising this kind of scepticismregarding AGCC. © Gebrüder Borntraeger, Stuttgart 2014."

On the basis of 97 climate skeptical non-fiction books, this article reconstructs the logical structure of climate skeptical (or denialist) arguments, with a special focus on the construction of the causes for climate change. The analysis shows that climate skeptical arguments are made on three levels: on the level of insight from climate science, on the level of an intui tive sociology of science and on a political/economic level, thus achieving the desired effect of moving the audience emotional ly. The reconstruction of arguments may serve as a basis for more quantitative research, but it is also useful for entering the debate with climate skeptics as it allows anticipating climate skeptical objections. © 2014 J.Soentgen, H.Bilandzic; licensee oekom verlag."
381,2-s2.0-84896132753,"Tourism scholars tend to endorse the most pessimistic assessments regarding climate change, despite the fact that it is a highly controversial scientific topic. This research note provides the balance that is missing from the overly alarmist studies on climate change and tourism. Notwithstanding the common notion in the academic tourism literature, recent research provides evidence that the mainstream reports on anthropogenic global warming are vastly exaggerated, and that human-induced greenhouse gas concentrations do not play a substantial role in climate change. In any case, whatever small degree of global warming is likely to occur, its net effects will most likely be positive for humans, plants and wildlife. Consequently, the recommendation to tourism scholars and policymakers is to exercise extra caution in the face of the fashionable belief of dangerous man-made climate change. In light of the current scientific literature, advocating and implementing radical environmental policies are likely to be ineffective, ill-timed and harmful to the tourism industry. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd."
382,2-s2.0-84884414934,"Global environmental change shapes places and people through ongoing transformation of ecological, socioeconomic, political, and cultural phenomena. One region construed as highly vulnerable to global environmental change, particularly anthropogenic climate change, is the North. Recent research about human communities in Western arctic and subarctic places revolve around vulnerability to anthropogenic climate change, focusing on loss of the ability to pursue traditional livelihoods, threats to ecosystems sustaining human communities and the need to adapt to new environmental regimes. Fewer studies address Russia and the perceptions and emotions related to climate change. To understand how people of the Russian North engage with climate change, I conducted ethnographic research in two rural and remote communities in subarctic alpine Kamchatka, Russia in 2009-2010. Local narratives about climate change largely reflect climate skepticism, and anthropogenic climate change is rejected as explaining environmental changes because: (1) climate is considered as naturally and cyclically changing, (2) humans are not considered a large enough force to alter natural climate cycles, (3) environmental problems are solvable with technology and (4) there is a lack of knowledge about climate change science. Thus, perceptions and emotions about transformation focus on other realms-socioeconomic, political, cultural-that are perceived as more critical to everyday life in the present and near future. Here, I describe these narratives and place the regional understanding of climate change in greater context to explain resistance to imagining environmental transformations due to climate change. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht."

This article is an examination of the four major schools of thought on climate change and how two newspapers in Uganda are covering those divergent views. The article argues that in the coverage of global warming in particular the hitherto treasured notion of objectivity has been replaced by a form of blind journalism instigated by frames from local and international stakeholders. The study analyses content from two newspapers in Uganda to show that media in Uganda cover the resonating frame, which argues that climate change is a time bomb, with total disregard for other views or their existence.

We find that denial of climate change is not widespread in Norway, but that scepticism about its impact and seriousness are fairly common. Investigation of the explanatory factors is based on three dominant explanations of climate change, namely lack of knowledge and information, differences in values and world views and differences in practice. By utilizing public opinion data collected by TNS Gallup on behalf of SIFO in November 2011, we find that the variables for knowledge level, world-views and environmentally friendly practice are all statistically significant in the analysis, but that the respondents' world-views are the strongest predictors of climate scepticism. Respondents with individualistic values and who voted for the Progress Party in the parliamentary election in 2009 are significantly more sceptical than others.

Climate issues include anthropogenic warming, due largely to ever-increasing greenhouse gas emissions, resulting in massive and irreversible upheaval of the biosphere and the socioeconomic system. Given the massive direct and indirect negative impact of climate change on health and mortality, due largely to the lethargy of politicians and big business, such people, in a saner world, could be facing accusation of crimes against humanity. The topic of climate change needs to become the backbone of education round the world, with simulation/gaming and debriefing being one of the main methods for learning to survive in 'pockets of resilience'. Topics for simulation/games and debriefing could include resilience, urgency, climate change science, indicators, and effects (feedback loops, rising sea levels, storm severity, food scarcity and security, water, war, denial, nuclear power, irresponsibility of politicians, etc.).

The second part focuses on the sceptical countermovement (or denial) in the country and analyses the framing strategies by which it constructs the 'non-problematicity' of the issue. Using Q methodology and qualitative data, three main topics are framed as 'uniquely Czech' by the majority of the active climate sceptics: (1) the sceptical nature of the 'ideologically resistant population' (caused by the historical experience with communism), (2) the unique (as well as ambivalent) role played by the most vocal Czech sceptic, president Václav Klaus, and (3) the 'natural' overlap of climate- and euroscepticism.

The results were compared to an earlier study on 12-year-olds, and the same coping strategies, problem-focused coping, de-emphasizing the seriousness of the threat, and meaning-focused coping, were identified. As in the study on children, problem-focused and meaning-focused coping were positively related to felt efficacy and environmental behavior, while de-emphasizing the threat was negatively related to these measures. As expected, the more problem-focused coping the adolescents used, the more likely it was that they experienced negative affect in everyday life. This association was explained by the tendency for highly problem-focused adolescents to worry more about climate change. In contrast, meaning-focused coping was positively related to both well-being and optimism. When controlling for well-known predictors such as values and gender, meaning-focused and problem-focused coping were independent positive predictors of environmental efficacy and pro-environmental behavior, while de-emphasizing the threat was a negative predictor of pro-environmental behavior.

Previous research, however, has shown that a significant minority of TV weathercasters disagree with the consensus science. Using multivariate analyses, this article identifies political ideology (conservative) and gender (male), but not age or science training, as predictors for being unconvinced that global warming is occurring; only ideology (conservative) predicts being unconvinced of anthropogenic causes of global warming. Ideology is also the strongest predictor, and gender is a secondary predictor, of trust in sources of climate change information: Conservative weathercasters expressed less trust in all seven science-based sources that were examined.

Problem-focused and meaning-focused coping had positive associations with measures of environmental engagement, while de-emphasizing the threat had negative associations with engagement.

In contrast, the more meaning-focused coping the children used the less they experienced negative affect, and the more they experienced life satisfaction, general positive affect, purpose, and optimism.

All but gone from the public and natural sciences discourse is any rationale that the environment is not actually the problem; rather, it is human behavior. The predictable result of focusing conservation and environmental research on effects (e.g., climate-change), is avoidance of their ultimate causes. This article argues that this is a form of mass social-institutional denial. People must consume, but they consume in excess for a variety of social and cultural reasons that are simply an extension of human nature. Technological fixes will do nothing more than postpone ""overshoot and collapse"" by 30-50 years, as recent studies show. Denying the origins and complexity of human motivation to consume, while focusing institutional research and public attention on ecological disturbances that exclude human beings is entirely doomed to failure as the environmental measures of the last 50 years demonstrate. Regrettably, 50 years of research has done little to improve the planet and the long-term security of humanity.

406,2-s2.0-84872199829,"The paper reviews the climatic changes that took place during the Quaternary, in particular those of the Holocene, including the historical time. The role of carbon dioxide, as a greenhouse gas, is emphasized since it is an important factor influencing the global climate. During the last century, a non-negligible increase in the atmospheric concentration of CO2 brought about a rise in global temperature attributed by many scientists to a man-made cause and labeled ""anthropogenic global warming "". It is claimed that a rapid (even exponential) increase in the content of man-made greenhouse gases (of which CO2 is the most important) in the atmosphere may have grave consequences for human society, such as a rise in the see level, desertification processes on a large scale, with ensuing water shortages, biological mass extinctions, many more violent meteorological phenomena, etc. A large group of scientists claimed that mathematical-statistical models predicted tremely alarming worldwide events and proceeded to popularize such consequences of global warming, emphasizing their catastrophic impact upon planet Earth and, especially, upon human society. Strong measures to counteract these man-made climatic changes were recommended. Again, such alarmist point of view other scientists advocated more research, since climate and its variations represent the most complex natural phenomenon. They questioned many conclusions of the adepts of global warming, conclusions drawn from the climate-statistical models (Global Circulation Models). This paper agrees with the skeptical scientists and advocates that more research is necessary before reaching a definitive conclusion, that it is indeed only mankind which is responsible for the present and future climate change and that the so-called science of anthropogenic climate change is settled and no more doubts should be expressed. In particular, the role and accuracy of mathematical models and the influence of climate feedbacks need much more research to confirm or negate the process of global anthropogenic warming. It is concluded that skepticism is a healthy scientific position and that alarmist and confrontational view points are not helpful in an ongoing discussion and, thus, a moderate and reasonable approach is recommended."

Finding ways to instill hope could therefore be seen as vital. However, is hope positively related to engagement or is it only a sign of illusory optimism? The aim of the study was to explore if hope concerning climate change has a significant relation to pro-environmental behavior as well as an impact on behavior when controlling for already well-known predictors such as values, social influence, knowledge, and gender. Two questionnaire studies were performed, one with a group of Swedish teenagers (n = 723) and one with a group of Swedish young adults (n = 381). 'Constructive' hope had a unique positive influence on pro-environmental behavior. Hope based on denial, however, was negatively correlated with pro-environmental behavior in the two samples and was a significant negative predictor in the teenage group.

We utilize public opinion data from ten Gallup surveys from 2001 to 2010, focusing specifically on five indicators of climate change denial. We find that conservative white males are significantly more likely than are other Americans to endorse denialist views on all five items, and that these differences are even greater for those conservative white males who self-report understanding global warming very well. Furthermore, the results of our multivariate logistic regression models reveal that the conservative white male effect remains significant when controlling for the direct effects of political ideology, race, and gender as well as the effects of nine control variables.

409,2-s2.0-79956263595,"While scientific consensus and political and media messages appear to be increasingly certain, public attitudes and action towards the issue do not appear to be following suit. Popular and academic debate often assumes this is due to ignorance or misunderstanding on the part of the public, but some studies have suggested political beliefs and values may play a more important role in determining belief versus scepticism about climate change. The current research used two representative postal surveys of the UK public to: measure scepticism and uncertainty about climate change; determine how scepticism varies according to individual characteristics, knowledge and values; and examine how scepticism has changed over time. Findings show denial of climate change is less common than the perception that the issue has been exaggerated. Scepticism was found to be strongly determined by individuals' environmental and political values (and indirectly by age, gender, location and lifestyle) rather than by education or knowledge. Between 2003 and 2008, public uncertainty about climate change has remained remarkably constant, although belief that claims about the issue are exaggerated has doubled over that period.

Drawing on the concept of framing from social movement theory, it uses qualitative field observations from the largest climate deniers conference in the United States and a data set of almost 800 op-eds from major news outlets over a 2-year period to examine how convinced and skeptical arguments of opposing logics employ frames and issue categories to make arguments about climate change. This article finds that the two logics are engaging in different debates on similar issues with the former focusing on solutions while the latter debates the definition of the problem. It concludes that the debate appears to be reaching a level of polarization where one might begin to question whether meaningful dialogue and problem solving has become unavailable to participants. The implications of such a logic schism is a shift from an integrative debate focused on addressing interests, to a distributive battle over concessionary agreements with each side pursuing its goals by demonizing the other. Avoiding such an outcome requires the activation of, as yet, dormant ""broker"" categories (technology, religion, and national security), the redefinition of existing ones (science, economics, risk, ideology), and the engagement of effective ""climate brokers"" to deliver them. © The Author(s) 2011."

There is still almost no admission that effective action to halt global warming will mean putting the global economy into sharp reverse and that peak oil will in any case have the same effect. As the political process gradually comes to acknowledge at least the basic facts, so an increasing literature of denial is appearing to reassure the public that there is nothing to worry about. Nevertheless, the 'Transition Towns/Cities' movement, that does acknowledge the challenge, is spreading rapidly amongst a certain segment of the population and involving many local authorities. However, the academic world of urban concern has yet to open its eyes to what lies in store. The paper ends with a brief analysis of the current planning process in London showing that the challenges are apparently accepted but what this will mean in terms of altered future reality and how to plan in that context is still absent. © 2010 Taylor & Francis."

All rights reserved.Be Very Afraid examines the human response to existential threats; once a matter for theology, but now looming before us in multiple forms. Nuclear weapons, pandemics, global warming; each threatens to destroy the planet, or at least to annihilate our species. Freud, the author notes, famously taught that the standard psychological response to an overwhelming danger is denial. In fact, the author writes, the opposite is true: we seek ways of positively meeting the threat, of doing something - anything - even if it is wasteful and time-consuming. The atomic era that began with the bombing of Hiroshima sparked a flurry of activity, ranging from duck-and-cover drills, basement bomb shelters, and marches for a nuclear freeze. All were arguably ineffectual, yet each sprang from an innate desire to take action. It would be one thing if our responses were merely pointless, the book observes, but they can actually be harmful. Both the public and policymakers tend to model reactions to grave threats on how we met previous ones. The response to the terrorist attacks of 9/11, for example, echoed the Cold War: citizens went out to buy duct tape, mimicking 1950s-era civil defense measures, and the administration launched two costly conflicts overseas."
416,2-s2.0-68249115057,"Speakers of the green backlash movement frequently advertise their approach as one of rigorous scepticism, and themselves as defenders of scientific method. In reality, their use of scepticism is often highly flawed and inconsistent; this is clearly seen in case examples focusing on Philip Stott's arguments on climate change, and Julian Simon's arguments on physical limits to growth. What this discourse illustrates is that sceptical language is often used as a rhetorical tool for advancing an underlying political philosophy that is based on an ideal of modern science as bestower of unlimited material power. In order to understand, and to criticise this discourse effectively, one needs to recall the criticisms made by the likes of Hayek and Arendt of scientismthe misuse of the language of science, and its aura of predictive certainty, to portray certain political visions as being inevitably true and triumphant."
417,2-s2.0-35748955784,"Taking climate change as the 21st century's major global threat, this paper considers three significant public relations challenges arising from it. The first is how the field can engage with the social equity and ecological dimensions in ways that might enhance rather than diminish the profession's public reputation. The second is how the discipline adapts to deal with the radical perceptual shifts accompanying the meteorological transformations and possible geopolitical fallout, and the third is the issue of trust - interlinked with emotions, economics, ecology, and neuroscience - as the strategy of eco-catastrophe denial becomes less and less tenable. The paper also considers possible responses to these challenges. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
418,2-s2.0-48649110715,"There is widespread consensus within the international scientific community that global warming is happening and that its causes are primarily anthropogenic. Future histories anticipate massive environmental and social upheaval unless carbon emissions are dramatically curtailed in the near future. Responses to the prospect of a hotter planet include welcome, refutation, avoidance and denial, and concerned activism. Denial is evident among those seeking to effect social change, including advocates of education for sustainable development. A fundamental issue for those advocates is the relevance of continuing to talk about development as the heating happens. An alternative, education for social contraction, is elaborated. © 2007, Inderscience Publishers."
419,2-s2.0-33746987021,"Global warming is the most serious environmental problem of our time and a major issue of environmental justice. Yet meager public response in the form of social movement activity, behavioral changes, or public pressure on governments is noteworthy in all Western nations. Existing research emphasizes lack of information as a limiting factor for failed public response. This explanation cannot account for the significant population who know about and express concern for global warming. Ethnographic and interview data from a rural Norwegian community indicate that nonresponse is at least partially a matter of socially organized denial. Because Norwegian economic prosperity is tied to oil production, collectively ignoring climate change maintains Norwegian economic interests. Most environmental justice research focuses on people facing disproportionate exposure to environmental problems. This project examines wealthy citizens who perpetuate global warming as they turn a blind eye. Environmental justice implications of socially organized denial are discussed for global warming and beyond. © 2006 Sage Publications."

In addition to an examination of newspaper articles, this paper includes a reflexive comparison with attendant wire stories and scientific texts. Special attention is given to articles constructed with and framed by rhetoric emphasising uncertainty, controversy, and climate scepticism. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
421,2-s2.0-84921633723,"© the several contributors, 2003. All rights reserved.Presents an analysis of multilateralism in American foreign environmental policy, focusing on the issues of ozone depletion, climate change, and biodiversity, and arguing that the evolution of US perspectives on environmental multilateralism reflects a fundamental split in the US policy arena. On one side are activists who seek to promote multilateral regulation of environmental issues and to deepen the US role therein. On the other hand are the sceptics, hostile to state and international regulation of environmental issues and preferring market solutions. The author suggests that, although sceptics have scored repeated short-term successes, the longer-term momentum favours the activists, and the US is gradually becoming more deeply embedded in multilateral environmental regimes."
